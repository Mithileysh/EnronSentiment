<88, [we recently installed two new digital copiers in the break room.  for the most part, they are very user friendly, and i have been able to make different types of copy jobs without any training at all.  however, we have the capability to provide formal training with a xerox representative on a prescheduled basis.  a training session, which can accommodate five people for training, is scheduled for thursday at 9:30 a.m.  the training takes an hour and a half.  if more than five individuals request training on thursday, i will schedule another training session at a later date.for your information, if you are not interested in formal training there is an instructional cd that you can borrow to learn about the features of the equipment, and there is a manual you can borrow if you would like to borrow it for instructional purposes.please contact me if you are interested in attending xerox training on thursday at 9:30 a.m. or if you would be interested in training at another time, and i will coordinate these training efforts.let me know if you have any questions.]>

"i would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"sighed the turkey, "but i haven t got the energy. "well, why don t you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull. "they re packed with nutrients." the turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. the next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of thetree. soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of thetree. management lesson: bullshit might get you to the top, but it won t keep you there. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~lesson number three ******************** when the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be boss. the brain said, "i should be boss     because i control the whole body s responses and functions."  the feet said, "we should be boss     as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go. " the hands said, "we should be the boss     because we do all the work and earn all the money." and so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes....  until finally the asshole spoke up.  all the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the boss. so the asshole went on strike,     blocked itself up and refused to work. within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered.eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the boss, so the motion was passed.  all the other parts did all the work while the boss just sat and passed outthe shit! management lesson: you don t need brains to be a boss - any asshole will do. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~lesson number four ******************* a little bird was flying south for the winter. it was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. while it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. as the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,it began to realize how warm it was. the dung was actually thawing him out! he lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. a passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,and promptly dug him out and ate him! management lessons: 1) not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 2) not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 3) and when you re in deep shit, keep your mouth shut! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~******************************************************************this email and any files transmitted with it from the elpaso corporation are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed. if you have received this email in error please notify the sender.******************************************************************]>

<35075, [mike, all of us working on the san diego defense of enron have beenattempting to watch the other class actions that we know have been filedrelated to the california electricity and gas markets.  the reason is thatif there is a state court class action that is broad enough to sweep enronin as a doe defendant and that case is not removed, then even if we aresuccessful in our efforts in hendricks and elsewhere it may all be fornought.   the rojoin case is somewhat different than the rest of the cases.it was filed december 6th, but we do not whether or when it was served.  italleges violations of the puc, unfair and deceptive practices, falseadvertising and fraudulent concealment against acn energy et. al arisingfrom their retail sales of electricity.  in essence, plaintiffs allege inrojoin that they were offered electricity at 3.4 cents per kwh when in factthe true charges to plaintiffs turned out to be about 15 cents per kwh.  oneof the allegations is that plaintiffs were not told of the "sneaky way thatthe fees are recalculated." in short, the rojoin complaint as written does not really addressthe wholesale market other than to allege that acn is acting to takeadvantage of the "deregulated" electricity market. counsel for one of the other defendants, chris healy, has commentedthat they have concerns that this case may be the weakest in terms ofremoval under a federal question.  if the defendants try to remove that caseand lose it could be harmful or undermine the basis for removal in the othercases.  as a practical matter, jean frizzel, dave noonan, mike kirby and itend to agree with him.  as you know, we are trying to find out who isrepresenting acn to see what they are planning to do. since the rojoin allegations are aimed exclusively right now at theresidential market, we thought it important to bring you up to date.  unlessees has a similar fact pattern to that alleged in the complaint (e.g. energyrates charged to customers as the higher of 3.4 cents per kwh or thedifference between 3 cents and the power exchange price without revealingwhat the power exchange price might be), this may be a stand alone casewhere it is unlikely that ees would be brought in. mike kirby and dave noonan are looking at the question of whether ifthe rojoin complaint is amended, new defendants would have the ability toseek removal then. bottom line - given the unique fact pattern of the rojoin case andsubject to your confirmation that ees does not have a similar fact pattern,it may make sense to just let the rojoin case alone and not attempt toinfluence counsel for the defense with respect to removal and focus ourefforts on the berg, continental forge and phillip cases. do you concur?thanksgary=======================================================this email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information. any unauthorized review, use, disclosure or distribution is prohibited. if you are not the intended recipient, please contact the sender by reply email and destroy all copies of the original message.to reply to our email administrator directly, send an email to postmaster@brobeck.combrobeck phleger & harrison llphttp://www.brobeck.com]>

<46004, [i just got this and thought you might find it interesting as well.amy--------- inline attachment follows ---------from:  <eric@ehirst.com>to: eric@ehirst.comdate: wednesday, august 1, 2001 12:16:55 gmtsubject: dear colleague,the edison electric institute just published a paper, the californiaelectricity crisis: lessons for other states, which i wrote. the paper isavailable on the publications page of my website, www.ehirst.com<http://www.ehirst.com/> . please let me know if you have any comments onthe paper.here is a summary of the paper:        california was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighterelectricity future. that future, as outlined by the california publicutilities commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuringcompetitive markets. such markets were intended to produce lower costs andmore choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energysuppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.        although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in april1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disasterfor california s electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.part of the fallout from california s electricity crisis is considerableconcern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricityindustry.         although a few states have decided, based on the californiaexperience, not to restructure, i believe that is the wrong outcome.instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from california arethat competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame forcalifornia s problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, andprices affect market outcomes.        section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricityregulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurredbeginning in may 2000. section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidanceto other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricityindustry. this section makes several points: *	maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for newgeneration to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and plannedto meet growing loads. *	ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and naturalgas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support largeregional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. *	encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing andvoluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesalemarkets). *	create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates withartificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies tooffer retail services without favoring individual competitors. *	encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supplyand price risks. *	create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,ancillary services, and transmission congestion. *	monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) andvertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation andtransmission).         ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs andprices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producerefficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improvereliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricingoptions.         but, this transition from one industry structure to another isturning out to be long and complicated. it is complicated becauseelectricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity isour most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energyto operate all our electronic equipment. also, electricity truly is areal-time product for which production and consumption must occur at thesame time.         although the problems that have occurred in california aresubstantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states shouldfocus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets andaccept the possible short-term problems that may occur. they also need torecognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyondthe boundaries of any single state. finally, competition in retail andwholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible tohave competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load facestime varying prices.         if states restructure properly to create competitive markets forwholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. consumers willenjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services andprice-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliabilityservices will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plantswill be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers. eric----------------------------------------------eric hirst consulting in electric-industry restructuring106 capital circleoak ridge, tn 37830*865-482-5470 (phone & fax)    *eric@ehirst.comhttp://www.ehirst.com <http://www.ehirst.com/>]>

competition is not to blame for california s problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.        section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurred beginning in may 2000. section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. this section makes several points:  maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.  ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.  encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).  create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.  encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.  create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.  monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).          ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.         but, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. it is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time.         although the problems that have occurred in california are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. they also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.         if states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers. eric----------------------------------------------eric hirst consulting in electric-industry restructuring106 capital circleoak ridge, tn 37830(865-482-5470 (phone & fax)    :eric@ehirst.comhttp://www.ehirst.com << file: http://www.ehirst.com/ >>]>

in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices.         if states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers. eric----------------------------------------------eric hirst consulting in electric-industry restructuring106 capital circleoak ridge, tn 37830(865-482-5470 (phone & fax)    :eric@ehirst.comhttp://www.ehirst.com << file: http://www.ehirst.com/ >>]>

competition is not to blame for california s problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.        section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurred beginning in may 2000. section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. this section makes several points:  maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.  ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.  encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).  create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.  encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.  create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.  monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).          ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options.         but, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. it is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society;

<120391, [in my interview i stressed that a big part of the communication problem is the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what s going on at enron.  narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and "impermanent" because very little information is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone).  this is, i believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication.  we now have some solutions emerging -- software that enables more people to record and post information in html format on company intranet sites.  i suspect that using such tools will face two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there s a huge need for training) and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organizationrichard amabile08/18/2000 05:20 pmto: mike mcconnell/hou/ect@ect, louise kitchen/hou/ect@ect, david gorte/hou/ect@ect, cindy olson/corp/enron@enron, james prentice/gpgfin/enron@enron, jan johnson/gpgfin/enron@enron, mark koenig/corp/enron@enron, sharon butcher/corp/enron@enron, mary clark/corp/enron@enron, gina taylor/ots/enron@enron, mike stewart/corp/enron@enron, dave schafer/ots/enron@enron, david a terlip/corp/enron@enron, joe kishkill/sa/enron@enron, marie hejka/corp/enron@enron, craig childers/hou/ees@ees, craig h sutter/hou/ees@ees, kirk mcdaniel/enron_development@enron_development, kathleen a cook/enron_development@enron_development, john ambler/enron_development@enron_development, keith sparks/enron_development@enron_development, james c lewis/enron_development@enron_development, ray bennett/hou/ees@ees, joseph w sutton/enron_development@enron_development, george wasaff/na/enron@enron, elizabeth tilney/hou/ees@ees, michael r brown/lon/ect@ect, andrew s fastow/hou/ect@ect, billy lemmons/corp/enron@enron, steven j kean/hou/ees@ees, scott yeager@ees, eric thode/corp/enron@enron, marie hejka/corp/enron@enron, cynthia barrow/hr/corp/enron@enron, john thompson/lon/ect@ect, nigel sellens/lon/ect@ect, david oxley/hou/ect@ect, drew c lynch/lon/ect@ect, marla barnard/enron communications@enron communications, robert.jones@enron.com, kimberly rizzi/hou/ect@ect, scott gilchrist/enron_development@enron_development, janie bonnard/enron_development@enron_development, willie.williams@enron.com, scott gilchrist/enron_development@enron_development, tim o rourke/corp/enron@enron, miguel padron/sa/enron@enron, gerry chatham/corp/enron@enron, cindy skinner/hou/ect@ect, ranendra sengupta/enron_development@enron_developmentcc: ksargent@cognitivearts.com subject: computer based communications training initiative -

<120395, [my message cut off...  the conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations, we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems .. .  solutions which have become available only recently.  why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible (eg by recording information and updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization.i think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on.  i am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements.   i am somewhat optimistic, though, that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at enron.richard amabile08/18/2000 05:20 pmto: mike mcconnell/hou/ect@ect, louise kitchen/hou/ect@ect, david gorte/hou/ect@ect, cindy olson/corp/enron@enron, james prentice/gpgfin/enron@enron, jan johnson/gpgfin/enron@enron, mark koenig/corp/enron@enron, sharon butcher/corp/enron@enron, mary clark/corp/enron@enron, gina taylor/ots/enron@enron, mike stewart/corp/enron@enron, dave schafer/ots/enron@enron, david a terlip/corp/enron@enron, joe kishkill/sa/enron@enron, marie hejka/corp/enron@enron, craig childers/hou/ees@ees, craig h sutter/hou/ees@ees, kirk mcdaniel/enron_development@enron_development, kathleen a cook/enron_development@enron_development, john ambler/enron_development@enron_development, keith sparks/enron_development@enron_development, james c lewis/enron_development@enron_development, ray bennett/hou/ees@ees, joseph w sutton/enron_development@enron_development, george wasaff/na/enron@enron, elizabeth tilney/hou/ees@ees, michael r brown/lon/ect@ect, andrew s fastow/hou/ect@ect, billy lemmons/corp/enron@enron, steven j kean/hou/ees@ees, scott yeager@ees, eric thode/corp/enron@enron, marie hejka/corp/enron@enron, cynthia barrow/hr/corp/enron@enron, john thompson/lon/ect@ect, nigel sellens/lon/ect@ect, david oxley/hou/ect@ect, drew c lynch/lon/ect@ect, marla barnard/enron communications@enron communications, robert.jones@enron.com, kimberly rizzi/hou/ect@ect, scott gilchrist/enron_development@enron_development, janie bonnard/enron_development@enron_development, willie.williams@enron.com, scott gilchrist/enron_development@enron_development, tim o rourke/corp/enron@enron, miguel padron/sa/enron@enron, gerry chatham/corp/enron@enron, cindy skinner/hou/ect@ect, ranendra sengupta/enron_development@enron_developmentcc: ksargent@cognitivearts.com subject: computer based communications training initiative -

wholesale markets are deregulated and rtos begin operating, the prudence==20principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be=20changed. for example, if ferc and rto monitors

<126537, [my message cut off...  the conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations, we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems .. .  solutions which have become available only recently.  why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible (eg by recording information and updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization.i think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on.  i am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements.   i am somewhat optimistic, though, that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at enron.richard amabile08/18/2000 05:20 pmto: mike mcconnell/hou/ect@ect, louise kitchen/hou/ect@ect, david gorte/hou/ect@ect, cindy olson/corp/enron@enron, james prentice/gpgfin/enron@enron, jan johnson/gpgfin/enron@enron, mark koenig/corp/enron@enron, sharon butcher/corp/enron@enron, mary clark/corp/enron@enron, gina taylor/ots/enron@enron, mike stewart/corp/enron@enron, dave schafer/ots/enron@enron, david a terlip/corp/enron@enron, joe kishkill/sa/enron@enron, marie hejka/corp/enron@enron, craig childers/hou/ees@ees, craig h sutter/hou/ees@ees, kirk mcdaniel/enron_development@enron_development, kathleen a cook/enron_development@enron_development, john ambler/enron_development@enron_development, keith sparks/enron_development@enron_development, james c lewis/enron_development@enron_development, ray bennett/hou/ees@ees, joseph w sutton/enron_development@enron_development, george wasaff/na/enron@enron, elizabeth tilney/hou/ees@ees, michael r brown/lon/ect@ect, andrew s fastow/hou/ect@ect, billy lemmons/corp/enron@enron, steven j kean/hou/ees@ees, scott yeager@ees, eric thode/corp/enron@enron, marie hejka/corp/enron@enron, cynthia barrow/hr/corp/enron@enron, john thompson/lon/ect@ect, nigel sellens/lon/ect@ect, david oxley/hou/ect@ect, drew c lynch/lon/ect@ect, marla barnard/enron communications@enron communications, robert.jones@enron.com, kimberly rizzi/hou/ect@ect, scott gilchrist/enron_development@enron_development, janie bonnard/enron_development@enron_development, willie.williams@enron.com, scott gilchrist/enron_development@enron_development, tim o rourke/corp/enron@enron, miguel padron/sa/enron@enron, gerry chatham/corp/enron@enron, cindy skinner/hou/ect@ect, ranendra sengupta/enron_development@enron_developmentcc: ksargent@cognitivearts.com subject: computer based communications training initiative -

<126538, [in my interview i stressed that a big part of the communication problem is the narrow and impermanent nature of the information about what s going on at enron.  narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and "impermanent" because very little information is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone).  this is, i believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication.  we now have some solutions emerging -- software that enables more people to record and post information in html format on company intranet sites.  i suspect that using such tools will face two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there s a huge need for training) and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organizationrichard amabile08/18/2000 05:20 pmto: mike mcconnell/hou/ect@ect, louise kitchen/hou/ect@ect, david gorte/hou/ect@ect, cindy olson/corp/enron@enron, james prentice/gpgfin/enron@enron, jan johnson/gpgfin/enron@enron, mark koenig/corp/enron@enron, sharon butcher/corp/enron@enron, mary clark/corp/enron@enron, gina taylor/ots/enron@enron, mike stewart/corp/enron@enron, dave schafer/ots/enron@enron, david a terlip/corp/enron@enron, joe kishkill/sa/enron@enron, marie hejka/corp/enron@enron, craig childers/hou/ees@ees, craig h sutter/hou/ees@ees, kirk mcdaniel/enron_development@enron_development, kathleen a cook/enron_development@enron_development, john ambler/enron_development@enron_development, keith sparks/enron_development@enron_development, james c lewis/enron_development@enron_development, ray bennett/hou/ees@ees, joseph w sutton/enron_development@enron_development, george wasaff/na/enron@enron, elizabeth tilney/hou/ees@ees, michael r brown/lon/ect@ect, andrew s fastow/hou/ect@ect, billy lemmons/corp/enron@enron, steven j kean/hou/ees@ees, scott yeager@ees, eric thode/corp/enron@enron, marie hejka/corp/enron@enron, cynthia barrow/hr/corp/enron@enron, john thompson/lon/ect@ect, nigel sellens/lon/ect@ect, david oxley/hou/ect@ect, drew c lynch/lon/ect@ect, marla barnard/enron communications@enron communications, robert.jones@enron.com, kimberly rizzi/hou/ect@ect, scott gilchrist/enron_development@enron_development, janie bonnard/enron_development@enron_development, willie.williams@enron.com, scott gilchrist/enron_development@enron_development, tim o rourke/corp/enron@enron, miguel padron/sa/enron@enron, gerry chatham/corp/enron@enron, cindy skinner/hou/ect@ect, ranendra sengupta/enron_development@enron_developmentcc: ksargent@cognitivearts.com subject: computer based communications training initiative -

<128056, [call me a "softie," but i couldn t help passing this one on.  have a great weekend! srs :-)first important lesson - everyone s job is importantduring my second month of nursing school, our professor gave us a pop quiz. i was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions, until i read the last one:"what is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?"surely this was some kind of joke. i had seen the cleaning woman several times. she was tall, dark-haired and in her 50 s, but how would i know her name? i left the question blank.just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade. "absolutely," said the professor. "in your careers, you will meet many people. all are significant. they deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say  hello .""i ve never forgotten that lesson. i also learned her name was dorothy.second important lesson - pickup in the rainone night, at 11:30 pm, an older african american woman was standing on the side of an alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rain storm. her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride. soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. a young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s.the man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxi cab. she seemed to be in a big hurry, but   wrote down his address and thanked him. seven days went by and a knock came on the man s door. to his surprise, a giant  onsole color tv was delivered to his home.a special note was attached. it read: "thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. the rain  drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. then you came along. because of you, i was able to make it to my dying husband s bedside just before he passed away. god bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others." sincerely, mrs. nat king cole.third important lesson - always remember those who serve.in the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. a waitress put a glass of water in front of him. "how much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked."fifty cents," replied the waitress.the little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it. "well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired.by now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient. "thirty-five cents," she brusquely  replied."the little boy again counted his coins. "i ll have the plain ice cream," he said. the waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. the boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left.when the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. there, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies -- you see, he couldn t have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.fourth important lesson - the obstacle in our pathin ancient times, a king had a boulder placed on a roadway. then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would  remove the huge rock.  some of the king s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. after much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. after the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed  a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. the purse contained many gold coins ad a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. the peasant learned what many of us never understand: every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.fifth important lesson - giving when it counts many years ago, when i worked as a volunteer at a hospital, i got to know a little girl named liz who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness.the doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. i saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, "yes, i ll do it if it will save her."as the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. then his face grew pale and his smile faded. he looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling  voice, "will i start to die right away?"being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.you see, after all, understanding and attitude, are everything.]>

from==20the western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of th=e=20western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and==20the industry=01,s evolution:1. increased deregulation uncertainty and risk =01) tension and differences==20between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the=20regulatory and political conundrum california=01,s investor-owned utilities= have=20faced. if federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets==20remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: will state regulators=20pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? tensions=20between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will gro=w=20if states delay or abandon retail competition.=20as wholesale markets are deregulated and rtos begin operating, the prudence==20principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be=20changed. for example, if ferc and rto monitors determine that deregulated==20wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be==20considered reasonable. if so, these costs should be allowed into=20state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles stat=e=20regulators have used for years. therefore, utilities=01, traditional burden= of=20proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators.2. reduced investor confidence =01) prior to deregulation, stringent pruden=ce=20review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulator=y=20risk largely uncontrollable, killing iou interests in most new investment. =a=20major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk=20could be managed, but california=01,s political and regulatory

<153842, [as anticipated when the constraints of having  the "luck of the draw" taken out of the equation, i have moved into a first  place draw with headley jones in our newly formatted hockey pool. i never  once drew first pick in all previous uncle buzzy pools (remember him?) , so  this feels particularly sweet. with one game left, all i need is one point  from either jason arnott or beretta blake to stand alone. my only worry is a  brodeur shut-out. i offered don headley a split earlier when i was 7  points back, but he chose to poke fun instead. charles, whose not even in the  pool, cried collusion, to which i explained to him that for this to be the case,  1. discussions would have had to be held "in camera"  and 2. others would have to be negatively impacted.  neither of these criteria were met. i was simply being a good  capitalist. regardless, our american friends have yet to pony  in, nor has galea ll, and i want my clams immediately! mcconvey ( in  perhaps the orangiest, sweetest moment of all), please send the $20 owing  to my employer s address below, i do not want you having  access to my home address. on as totally separate note, i m beginning to now  look past when my son yanic arrives and hold true in my very public decree that  having a child will not totally change my life. as such, we should open up  discussions on a second annual road trip, perhaps in late september? i know  glove is very interested this year, and i m sure lav could be pried away from  cooking his companies books for a long week-end. we could always do tremblant  again, but i m in mack s corner (for the first time ever!) in stating that i  could care less if we golf!!! perhaps we could do vegas, visit lav or glove (  which their respective wives would love) or simply go to my cottage. it doesn t  really matter, as long as we re together for a few laughs!!!!!! air canada is  offering $235 flights to norfolk and charleston, but that would obviously mean  golf, which increasingly irritates me with all its gimmicky  bullshit!! so the floor is open for discussion, and knowing us  , i hope you all have enough space in your hard drive for the written  diarrhea that you re about to be assaulted with over the next month, until we  can all agree on something! are you ready charles? (" if he s in, i m out!)".  hey mcconvey, are you going live a little outside that weston comfort zone of  yours and spend a few shillings elsewhere? let the witchypooing begin. i ll explain that to  you later lav.  joseph galeamcgown intermac inc.160 bloor  street eastsuite # 1124toronto, ontario  m4w 1b9ph. #  416-966-1622fax. # 416-966-1434]>

[image] there are no guarantees  the first thing you need to =know about investing is this: whenever you invest, whether in stocks, bonds=, or even if you simply keep your dollars in a money market fund, there is =no guarantee you ll make a profit. with some investments, you could even lo=se money, ending up with less than you started with. armed with the right k=nowledge, however, you can improve your odds of success significantly, bala=ncing the risks of investing with the potential rewards.   [image] balancin=g risk and reward  whenever you invest, you expose your money to some level= of risk. you might not think about it, but there is risk involved no matte=r what you do with your money. most people recognize that stashing their li=fe savings under a mattress or in a cookie jar comes with the risk that the=ir money could be stolen (where do you think burglars look first when they =rob a house?) or destroyed (you might be able to find a fire-proof cookie j=ar, but your bed is definitely not safe in that department).  investing in =the stock market has its own kinds of risks. a stock you purchase might go =up or down in price (what s known as "fluctuation"). stocks are volatile by= their very nature, and that s part of the inherent risk of investing in st=ocks. in the worst case, a stock could even become worthless and cause you =to lose 100% of your investment. however, it s important to recognize that =there are different kinds of stocks, and some stocks are riskier than other=s. you can t ever eliminate the risk associated with investing in stocks-bu=t you can certainly tame it and even put some of those volatile tendencies =to work for your benefit.   keeping up with inflation  there is another imp=ortant kind of risk to consider-- even if you re investing in bonds or just= keeping your money in the bank. there s the risk that your investment won =t grow fast enough to keep up with the effects of inflation. over the years=, inflation has grown at about three to four percent a year on average. if =your money is sitting in a bank collecting interest at less than the rate o=f inflation, then that money will actually be worth less when you withdraw =it at some point down the road.   not being afraid of risk whenever you see=k higher returns, you must accept higher risk. the key is to balance the am=ount of risk appropriate for your circumstances (what experts call your ris=k tolerance) with the amount of reward you want to achieve. every person ha=s a different tolerance for risk, and it s up to you to decide for yourself= how to build a portfolio that will serve you best.  historically, investin=g in stocks offers the chance to earn higher returns than investing in bond=s or keeping your money in the bank, but that opportunity comes with higher= risk. the essence of successful investing, though, is understanding and ac=cepting the fact that risk is unavoidable -- and managing that risk so you =can still sleep soundly at night.   [image]investing, dollar by dollar   an= important concept that you can put to work when you use sharebuilder  to i=nvest in stocks is dollar-cost averaging. while this may sound like some co=mplicated strategy, it s really not so difficult to understand. when you us=e dollar-cost averaging, you automatically invest a fixed amount each week =or month in the purchase of a single security. that s all there is to it!  =why is dollar-cost averaging such a good long-term strategy? stock prices c=an be volatile, rising and falling from week to week and month to month. wh=en you make a weekly or monthly purchase, the price of the stock may be hig=her or lower than it was the month before. if you invest $100 a month, for =example, then your $100 will buy fewer shares when the price is high and mo=re shares when the price is low -- automatically. while dollar-cost averagi=ng doesn t assure a profit, over time the average cost of your shares will =generally tend to be lower than if you had made a single one-time investmen=t of the same amount.   you might be using dollar-cost averaging right now =without even knowing it. if you invest in a 401(k) or other retirement plan= at work, you contribute a fixed amount each pay period to your account, wh=ich is then used to buy shares in one or more mutual funds. over time, your= regular purchases will probably reduce the average cost you pay for all yo=ur shares -- and that can help increase your returns.   you should recogniz=e that dollar-cost averaging doesn t protect you from investment losses. an=d a stock can decline until it s worthless -- so don t count on dollar-cost= averaging to protect you from the damage caused by buying a bad stock.  sh=arebuilder is designed to make dollar-cost averaging easy by allowing you t=o buy in dollar amounts - dollar-based investing. when you buy stocks at a =typical brokerage, you can only buy whole shares. if your chosen stock sell=s for $70 a share, and you have $200 to invest, then you can only buy two s=hares for $140 (plus commissions). the remaining $60 has to sit on the side=lines until the next month (which means it can t be working for you in your= portfolio).   if you have $50 a month to invest at a typical brokerage, an=d the stock you ve selected currently sells for $85 a share, what do you do=? either you wait until you scrape together the remaining $35 (and hope the= price doesn t go higher), or you find another stock.  with sharebuilder, d=ollar-based investing means you can purchase fractional shares with the ent=ire amount of your investment dollars. your $200 will buy you 2.857 shares =of your $70 stock (without commissions). or your $50 will buy you 0.588 sha=res of your $85 stock, so you don t have to put off investing until tomorro=w.   [image] putting it all together  understanding these three basic conce=pts is key to becoming a successful investor.   you must be aware of the ri=sks of investing. understand how you can use strategies like dollar- cost a=veraging to invest in stocks. if you invest with your eye on the long-term,= you can often ride out bumpy times in the market.

<196835, [fyi, kim.-----original message-----from: gold, amy [mailto:agold@coral-energy.com]sent: wednesday, august 01, 2001 11:25 amto: watson, kimberlysubject: fw: new report on lessons from californiai just got this and thought you might find it interesting as well.amy--------- inline attachment follows ---------from:  <eric@ehirst.com>to: eric@ehirst.comdate: wednesday, august 1, 2001 12:16:55 gmtsubject: dear colleague,the edison electric institute just published a paper, the californiaelectricity crisis: lessons for other states, which i wrote. the paper isavailable on the publications page of my website, www.ehirst.com<http://www.ehirst.com/> . please let me know if you have any comments onthe paper.here is a summary of the paper:        california was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighterelectricity future. that future, as outlined by the california publicutilities commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuringcompetitive markets. such markets were intended to produce lower costs andmore choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energysuppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.        although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in april1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disasterfor california s electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.part of the fallout from california s electricity crisis is considerableconcern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricityindustry.         although a few states have decided, based on the californiaexperience, not to restructure, i believe that is the wrong outcome.instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from california arethat competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame forcalifornia s problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, andprices affect market outcomes.        section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricityregulation and restructuring in california and the problems that occurredbeginning in may 2000. section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidanceto other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricityindustry. this section makes several points: *	maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for newgeneration to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and plannedto meet growing loads. *	ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and naturalgas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support largeregional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. *	encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing andvoluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesalemarkets). *	create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates withartificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies tooffer retail services without favoring individual competitors. *	encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supplyand price risks. *	create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,ancillary services, and transmission congestion. *	monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) andvertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation andtransmission).         ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs andprices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producerefficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improvereliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricingoptions.         but, this transition from one industry structure to another isturning out to be long and complicated. it is complicated becauseelectricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity isour most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energyto operate all our electronic equipment. also, electricity truly is areal-time product for which production and consumption must occur at thesame time.         although the problems that have occurred in california aresubstantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states shouldfocus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets andaccept the possible short-term problems that may occur. they also need torecognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyondthe boundaries of any single state. finally, competition in retail andwholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible tohave competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load facestime varying prices.         if states restructure properly to create competitive markets forwholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. consumers willenjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services andprice-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliabilityservices will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plantswill be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers. eric----------------------------------------------eric hirst consulting in electric-industry restructuring106 capital circleoak ridge, tn 37830*865-482-5470 (phone & fax)    *eric@ehirst.comhttp://www.ehirst.com <http://www.ehirst.com/>]>

<208328, [please respond to pennfuture=20pennfuture s e-cubed is a commentary biweekly email  publication concerning= the current themes and trends in the energy market.=20july 16, 2001vol. 3, no. 13market lessons from 2000=20school s still out for summer, but just as the new and improved  federal en=ergy regulatory commission (ferc) issued a watershed rto decision last  wee=k which could lead to substantial expansion of pjm into the northeast, pjm =s  state of the market report 2000 contains some interesting information an=d  lessons for us.=20after the california experience demonized spot electricity  markets, it wou=ld surprise many that pjm s 2000 spot energy market was a  bargain. spot pr=ices in 2000 were below $30.00 per megawatt-hour (mwh), or three  cents per= kilowatt-hour (kwh), 70.88 percent of the hours in the year. the  single h=ighest hourly price was $810 per mwh or 81 cents per kwh, but prices  reach=ed or exceeded $200 per mwh during only 13 hours in the entire year  (downl=oad charts on our website by typing www.pennfuture.org/items/hourlypricecha=rts_71601.pdf  in your browser). by contrast, california experienced spot  =prices that often exceeded $200 per mwh for most of the last 12 months.authored by the pjm market monitoring unit - but likely reviewed  and edite=d by top pjm management - the report delivered to ferc concludes that  all =of the markets operated by pjm were "reasonably competitive." it cautions, = however, that,"there are potential threats to competition in the energy,  capacity and re=gulation markets that require ongoing scrutiny and in some cases  may requi=re action in order to maintain competition. market participants do  possess= some ability to exercise market power under certain conditions in pjm  mar=kets."=20in order to maintain and improve the functioning of the pjm  markets, the r=eport recommends:retention of the $1000/mwh bid cap in the pjm energy market  and investigat=ion of other rule changes to reduce incentives to exercise  market power.retention of the $100/mw bid cap in the pjm regulation market. =20evaluation of additional actions to increase demand-side  responsiveness to= price in both energy and capacity markets.modification of incentives in the capacity market to require  all load serv=ing entities (lses) to meet their obligations to serve load on a  longer-te=rm basis, and require all capacity resources to be offered on a  comparable= longer-term basis.the report uses several analytical methods to reach these  recommendations =and conclusions, including looking at the net revenue for  generation from =all sources, the increase in bid amount over marginal cost,  market concent=ration (as measured using the hhi index), and lastly an analysis  of the re=sulting prices.=20see spot go to marketperhaps the report s most intriguing  information on price trends concerns =the spot energy market, where average  prices declined by 9.81 percent from= 1999 levels. driven by lower peak prices in  the most expensive 100 hours =of the year, the average locational marginal price  (lmp) in 2000 was $30.7=2 per mwh (3.072 cents per kwh), falling from the 1999  average of $34.06 p=er mwh (3.406 cents per kwh). this average price decline in  the spot marke=t was more significant because it occurred even though fuel costs  were sha=rply higher in 2000. indeed, the average fuel-adjusted lmp in 2000  decline=d to $24.78 per mwh, or 27.25 percent from the 1999 price of $34.06 per  mw=h.=20and when one compares 2000 spot market prices to competitive  future prices= for the year 2000 and to 1996 regulated rates for generation, it  becomes =clear that spot market prices in 2000 were significantly lower than 2000  f=uture contracts. even with appropriate price adjustments to facilitate  com=parison, they were also much lower than 1996 regulated residential generati=on  rates for all hours charged by pennsylvania s six major electric utilit=ies,  which ranged from about $51 dollars to $85 dollars per mwh, or 5.1 to= 8.5 cents  per kwh.=20the lessonspot market prices, which received so much bad  publicity as a result of th=e california fiasco, can be a bargain and customers  who are able to manage= their demand to reduce or avoid the hours of high spot  prices can reap ma=jor savings by purchasing electricity from the spot  market.in fact, spot market prices in 2000 were below most of  pennsylvania s shop=ping credits or "prices to compare." that s saying something,  since the sh=opping credits in turn are as much as 4.0 cents per kwh less than  the 1996= regulated rate for just generation paid by customers to the monopoly  util=ities.=20but?since spot market prices in 2000 were well below both  the 1996 generation =rate paid to monopolies and the much lower shopping credits,  why were ener=gy suppliers increasingly unable to offer electricity at prices  below the =shopping credits?=20icap pricing and reliance by electricity suppliers on higher  priced future= or forward market contracts supply most of the answer.=20the spot market gives a good indication of what the forward  markets should= be under typical circumstances. as the data below indicate, the  average s=pot market price for all market locations in 2000 was $30.72/mwh,  almost 1=0 percent less than during 1999, and more than 27 percent lower upon  adjus=ting for higher year 2000 fuel prices.=20=09=09=09  pjm load-weighted average lmp ($/mwh) =09  =09  1999 =09  2000 =09  change =09  average lmp =09  34.06 =09  30.72 =09

-27.25% =09  median fuel adjusted lmp =09  19.02 =09  16.80 =09  -11.67% =09  standard deviation =09  91.49 =09  22.04 =09  -75.91% =09=20while the dramatically lower standard deviation in 2000 indicates  that pri=ces were much less volatile than in 1999, there remained a substantial  gap= between average and median prices, indicating that extreme prices during a=  small number of hours continued to substantially skew overall average pri=ces. =20grading on a curvethe pjm 2000 price duration curves,  measuring the percent of time prices w=ere at or below a particular level, tell  an interesting story. as one woul=d expect with higher fuel prices, especially  for natural gas, the general =trend was for prices to be slightly higher during  periods where natural ga=s was the marginal fuel. for approximately 99 percent of  all hours, 2000 e=nergy prices were more expensive than in 1999. yet, with  relatively low pe=ak demand, the price for the most expensive 1 percent of demand  during 200=0 was considerably lower in 2000 than in 1999, accounting for the  entire 9=.81 percent average reduction in 2000 prices from 1999. if not  for the red=uced prices for the most expensive 1 percent of demand, overall  prices for= 2000 likely would have risen approximately 18 percent over 1999, due  larg=ely to higher fuel costs.=20for these reasons, the report recommendation to "evaluate"  additional acti=ons to increase demand-side responsiveness is severely  understated. pjm an=d all consumers have an essential interest in implementing  demand-side res=ponse programs to the maximum economic level, with dramatic  implications f=or saving individual consumers money, improving system  reliability, keepin=g market prices lower for everyone, and improving market  competitiveness.==20can everyone say i-c-a-p?so with the lower wholesale  energy prices and plenty of supply, why did th=e retail market sputter?=20installed capacity (icap) price increases are a partial  explanation. in ad=dition to energy, the controversial charge for icap is the  other significa=nt cost born by electricity consumers within pjm. icap represents  a call o=ption on physical generation resources by pjm during system emergencies.  a=ll lses are required to purchase an amount of installed capacity equivalent= to  their customer s peak load contribution plus an adequate reserve margi=n,  currently 19 percent. but although it exists for reliability purposes, =pjm  curtailed the export of energy outside pjm from pjm-committed installe=d capacity  on only one day during 2000.=20logically, the price for installed capacity, like the price of  energy, mig=ht have been expected to decrease during 2000. yet that didn t occur.  as e=nergy prices decreased within pjm, they remained high or continued to  incr=ease in surrounding control areas. higher prices in the surrounding markets=  led some generation owners to de-list their generation committed to pjm i=n order  to sell out to other control areas without the risk of being curta=iled by pjm.  the result was an increase in icap prices from an average of =$52.86 in 1999 to  $60.55 in 2000. the increase was concentrated over the s=ummer with prices in the  daily markets rising to $177 or more for most of =june, july and august. the  increase in icap prices raised the cost of supp=lying many retail customers by  about 1 cent per kwh. the market monitoring= unit concluded that the price spikes  over the summer months were a direct= result of the opportunity cost associated  with the prices in neighboring =control areas.but the report s finding that the icap market was "reasonably  competitive"= seems inconsistent with pjm s conclusion last year that the 2000  icap mar=ket performed so poorly that it needed a major overhaul. this  inconsistenc=y raises questions about the reasonableness of that portion of the  2000 re=port or giving the 2000 icap market the pjm seal of approval.=20pjm has invested substantial time and resources since last summer  in an ex=tensive stakeholder process to revise its icap rules, especially  concernin=g the allocation of deficiency revenues and the interval over which  icap i=s purchased. but since the "reformed" icap market began operating only  rec=ently on july 1, 2001, it s too soon to know whether it is functioning well=  or competitively. we remain skeptical that the pjm prescription cures the=  disease, or is merely life support for a dying program.=20see spot offer lower pricesapart from the icap market, the  differing prices in forward and spot marke=ts provide substantial explanations  for why electricity suppliers have fou=nd it easy to beat the 1996 regulated  generation rate for most utilities b=ut difficult or even impossible to beat the  lower shopping credits. (shopp=ing credit =3d 1996 regulated generation rate -  stranded generation cost).= prior to the 2000 summer season, prices in the  forward markets, before an=yone knew how mild the weather was going to be,  substantially reflected th=e high-priced experience of 1999. because of the high  prices in 1999, ener=gy that was purchased through forward markets - about 82  percent of all en=ergy - was considerably more expensive than the spot prices  turned out to =be. since customers often prefer to lock in a price in advance,  competitiv=e suppliers generally didn t want to provide fixed prices below the  retail= shopping credits. if suppliers had relied on the spot market, they could  =have offered lower prices. also, customers who can reduce or shift demand m=ay  well benefit from purchasing more power from the spot market.=20recent developmentsboth in the east and west coast markets  this week, electricity in daily tr=ading has been near its low for the 52-week  period. several developments a=re pushing down the price of wholesale  electricity. mild weather, falling =gas prices, new generation coming online,  increasing demand response and c=onservation as well as a ferc which understands  that competition must exis=t prior to price deregulation, are all pushing prices  lower. moreover, for=ward market prices for 2002 within pjm are beginning to fall  and are under= downward price pressure.=20the new downward trend in forward markets partially results from  moderate =prices this summer, even during high demand periods, with prices  generally= staying under $150 mwh/$0.15 kwh. a good example of this was july 10,  a r=elatively hot day with significant demand, which saw prices reach $150 per = mwh for one hour but average $62.78 per mwh for all on-peak hours.=20what s driving forward prices lower?more efficient generation being installed (below 8000 btu/kwh  as opposed t=o 11000 btu/kwh).more icap in the market (new capacity estimated at over 4000  mw with load =growth at only 1.5 percent or 1000 mw).more demand-responsive load in the form of 300 additional mw  of active loa=d management.the addition of pjm west slated for 2002, with lower prices  generally.=20lower natural gas prices - falling from $4.0561 /mmbtu in july  2000 to $3.=29/mmbtu as of july 12, 2001.this good news, which suggests that retail customers in late 2001  or 2002 =may again see retail competitive offers below the pennsylvania shopping  cr=edits, must be weighed against the troubled icap market. icap remains an  a=nachronism. icap prices have not returned to competitive levels and remain =one  of the significant obstacles to serving retail customers. the forward =prices for  icap alone have remained above 10 percent of the typical shoppi=ng credit.=20yet even in the world of icap there is hope. icap prices may be  beginning =to soften in the face of a substantial amount of new generation that  is co=ming online and increased demand response from customers. pjm has  institut=ed both an emergency and an economic demand-response program, through  whic=h more customers can respond to prices and reduce the price that all  custo=mers pay for electricity.=20tomorrow s homeworkthe state of the market report contains  plenty of data which confirms that= pjm is the country s best-run independent  system operator and best (thoug=h still flawed) wholesale market. prices in the  spot energy market were we=ll below 1996 regulated generation rates, even with  appropriate adjustment=s. but none of this warrants complacency. only when pjm  becomes the first =market to give consumers the tools they need to change their  demand for el=ectricity, will the wholesale and retail markets within pjm be  fully, as o=pposed to "reasonably," competitive.a link to download (in .pdf) the pjm mmu report can be found on  the intern=et at: http://www.pjm.com/market_monitoring/reports.html .=20e-cubed is available for reprint in  newspapers and other publications. aut=hors are available for print or  broadcast.pennfuture (www.pennfuture.org ), with  offices in harrisburg, philadelphia= and pittsburgh, is a statewide public  interest membership organization, w=hich advances policies to protect and improve  the state s environment and =economy. pennfuture s activities include litigating  cases before regulator=y bodies and in local, state and federal courts,  advocating and advancinglegislative action on a state and federal level,  public education and assi=sting citizens in public advocacy.to  unsubscribe, simply reply to this email with "unsubscribe" in the  subj=ect. - vol3no13_71601.doc]>

were significantly lower than 2000 ==20future contracts. even with appropriate price adjustments to facilitate =20comparison, they were also much lower than 1996 regulated residential=20generation

contribution plus an==20adequate reserve margin,  currently 19 percent. but although it exists for==20reliability purposes, pjm  curtailed the export of energy outside pjm from==20pjm-committed

as ener=gy=20prices decreased within pjm, they remained high or continued to  increase i=n=20surrounding control areas. higher prices in the surrounding markets  led so=me=20generation owners to de-list their generation committed to pjm in order  to==20sell out to other control areas without the risk of being curtailed by pjm.= =20the result was an increase in icap prices from an average of $52.86 in 1999==20to  $60.55 in 2000. the increase was concentrated over the summer with pric=es=20in the  daily markets rising to $177 or more for most of june, july and=20august. the  increase in icap prices raised the cost of supplying many reta=il=20customers by  about 1 cent per kwh. the market monitoring unit concluded th=at=20the price spikes  over the summer months were a direct result of the=20opportunity cost associated  with the prices in neighboring control areas.but the report=01,s finding that the icap market was "reasonably  competiti=ve"=20seems inconsistent with pjm=01,s

wholesale markets are deregulated and rtos begin operating, the prudence==20principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be=20changed. for example, if ferc and rto monitors determine that deregulated==20wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be==20considered reasonable. if so, these costs should be allowed into=20state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles stat=e=20regulators have used for years. therefore, utilities=01, traditional burden= of=20proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators.2. reduced investor confidence =01) prior to deregulation, stringent pruden=ce=20review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulator=y=20risk largely uncontrollable,

(dyn), aes corp. and williams energy as defendants.the plaintiffs are seeking at least $4 billion in damages for electricity supply bought through the california power exchange last summer.the "class" - the plaintiffs - are defined as anybody who bought power through the california power exchange last summer, but largely represents the 1.2 million customers of sempra energy unit (sre) san diego gas & electric co., according to the complaint.the complaint alleges the defendants violated antitrust laws.the plaintiffs allege that the generators named in the suit deliberately withheld their power supply from the calpx forward market, scheduled unplanned power plant outages and congested transmission lines last summer in an effort to drive up wholesale power prices.houston-based reliant energy inc. (rei), operates five power plants in california. atlanta-based southern company (so) operates six generation units in the state; houston-based duke energy (duk) operates four power plants; houston-based dynegy (dyn) operates eight power plants in california; arlington, va.-based aes operates four, tulsa, okla.-based williams energy operates three generation units and minneapolis-based nrg operates eight power plants.in addition, the suit claims the california independent system operator, manager of the state s high voltage transmission system, wrongfully supplied the western systems coordinating council, an agency that manages electricity reliability in the west, with real-time information about power plant outages and electricity generating and capacity levels that was used by generators to manipulate the market."through the wscc internet web site, wholesale electricity market participants ... were thereby given access to real-time data as to their competitors  actions, although access to such data was forbidden by the iso s (rules)," the complaint states."starting on or about may 22, 2000, defendants used such real-time data to exercise market power, by among other things, reducing their (electricity) output, strategically underbidding supply to the forward markets and exporting electricity from the state in order to drive up" power prices, the complaint further states.the defendants weren t immediately available for comment.-by jason leopold, dow jones newswires; 323-658-3874; mailto:jason.leopold@dowjones.com(end) dow jones newswires 28-11-002358gmt]>

<218396, [it s worth noting too (perhaps as part of jeff s first or second points) that in addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps, and the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  the turbine market is a worldwide market.  firms will have difficulty committing their own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other than the operation of the market.  several generators, including dynegy and calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have ordered.	jeff dasovich	sent by: jeff dasovich	11/17/2000 02:44 pm		 		 to: robert hemstock/cal/ect@ect, skean@enron.com		 cc: 		 subject: hard lessons from california    rob:here s a quick and dirty list of some lessons from california that alberta may not want to repeat.  steve, let me know if i ve missed any messages we re using to describe california s woes (or mangled any, for that matter.  if you have any questions, don t hestitate to get in touch. best,jeff]>

<219031, [hi everyone,as you know, we ve had a few problems this semester with the audio on thevideotapes that have been made.  in talking with the media center, severalsuggestions were made that i would like to share with you:(1)  the media center uses the "passing time" to set up the video equipmentin each classroom.  the passing time for classes that do not have anotherclass in the room previously is from 5:50 pm to 6:00 pm.  the passing timefor classes that do have another class in the room previously is from 5:55to 6:05 pm.  it would be very helpful to the media center if students didnot enter the classroom until the end of the passing time.  one of theproblems has been that the technicians have been rushed because of theincoming and outgoing flow of students, and they do not have time to ensurethat all the equipment is fully functioning.(2)  the media center would also like to request that students wait untilthe end of the passing time to enter the room because several of theirtechnicians have been injured (sprained ankles, etc.) when students step ontheir feet and legs while they re taping cables to the floor.(3)  please be sure to avoid placing any papers, binders, etc. over themicrophones that are placed on the tables.hopefully, the above three steps will help improve the "audio portion ofthis broadcast."thanks!diane]>

"p&d" sessions are meant to focus on results and assist in producing measurable performance improvements.  "p&d" sessions are to assist our employees in driving change in an organized, efficient and effective manner.  it will help us leverage off our own best practices to produce faster results that positively impact our return on invested capital. at enron we give our employees the power to dissent and with that power comes the obligation to participate in providing solutions/ideas. if you have any questions about this material, please feel free to contact kirk mcdaniel or myself.  we will be happy to answer your questions and provide additional context for the effort.the only other thing we would like you to do prior to attending the session is to identify a potential p&d intervention within your own organization.  this will provide you with a "real" effort to begin planning for at the session and make the application of the ideas directly actionable for you.we look forward to seeing you at the meeting.            dick amabile]>

<265592, [the people on the "to" list have been selected to attend an "energy math" training session which will be held on march 7th from 9 am to 5 pm in the river room at two world trade center.  amy fitzpatrick will provide you with a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by monday morning.  we want to have 15 people attend this course.  i realize that this is short notice, so if you can t attend please let me know asap so that i can find a replacement.i have been working with jon koomey, who will be teaching the course, over the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the needs of people who work on this floor.  the goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the foundation of analyzing energy problems.  the course is loosely based on a graduate level course offered at berkeley (which jon has taught and several people on the floor have taken) and on a book that jon koomey recently published.this is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being offered.  as a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.  chris calger and i would like every person in this office to have the opportunity to take this course between now and the end of the year.  we have selected a cross-section of people for this first session.  some people have a lot of experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.  some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others are new to the business.  we are hoping that the course will be helpful to people with different backgrounds.  each participant in the class is not only responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give constructive feedback to jon koomey and to us on how to make the course better.  you will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide feedback.  this feedback is part of the program.  if you aren t willing or don t feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list for this session.based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the next course is offered in a month or so.  with your help, we will be able to improve the training for the people who come after you.  thanks in advance for your help with this, and i hope that you find this training to be helpful.tim belden]>

<267974, [x-filename: cara semperger 6-26-02.pstfirst i hope that i have everyone s correct e-mail. i guess time will tell on that.second i want to thank all of you for participating in the so training workshop in phoenix. your input to date will help nerc define its role in training, and we hope improve on the training that is currently available to system operators, schedulers, marketers, and planners.as promised attached are the flip chart notes from the workshop for you to look at and hopeful you will add more comments. i know that some attendees refrained from speaking out so here is your chance. also i have included the complied results of the questionnaire that you filled out in class. i included this so you can see what others felt of the workshop and of the effort that nerc is undertaking in regards to the future of training. maybe these notes will stimulate further thoughts and ideas. these are unedited versions.i intentionally did not want to present some formal recommendation or program at this workshop because nerc (not just me) felt that it was important to get your opinions before drafting any program. this workshop will become the basis of what nerc will be doing in the future. training is important, that was oblivious from some of our discussions. through your input i can start to draft an outline of what nerc s role will be, what training is needed, and who needs the training. i can see now that there are varying levels of training that will be required. some wish simple overviews, others want details and structure. what is the next step? each of you should review these documents and make comments, add other ideas that maybe you did not think of at the workshop. talk about this with your fellow coworkers, seek their opinions and then send those comments back to me. i will then add any additional comments i receive to the flip chart document and try to define some of those thoughts and return them to each of you. after that i will start to draft a plan and/or program that will be posted for public comments. after public comments are received and reviewed, a second draft will be written and posted. this final draft may require approval (from the oc or bot) before nerc rolls out any program.timeline:first draft of so workshop notes        sent            10/10/01comments on notes due to nerc by                10/31/01 ? this is your deadline to return any comments to me.second draft of so workshop notes sent          11/16/01first draft of nerc training program/role       11/23/01white paper on role and training program posted 12/07/01public comments due     (45 days from posting)  01/21/02final draft of action plan for nerc             02/08/02oc or bot approval of action plan (open)                (unknown - depends on who will approve and when their meeting is held)again thanks for your help and participation. remember with your help we can improve the quality and timeliness of training for everyone.john theotonio<<flip chart notes.doc>> <<so training workshop questionnaire results.doc>> john theotoniomanager - trainingnorth american electric reliability councilprinceton forrestal village116-390 village boulevardprinceton, new jersey 08540phone: 609-452-8060 ext. 122fax: 609-452-9550email: john.theotonio@nerc.net]>

<297845, [mexico-	power strike set for march 16 in mexico citysome 35,000 members of the mexican union of electrical workers plan to strike the mexico city electric company on friday, march 16th at 12 noon. the union is demanding a 29 percent salary increase and the company is offering nothing. the two sides are not even talking. the union is concerned that the government may try to force the electrical workers to stay on their jobs or bring in replacements. the union is also opposed to the privatization of the electric company and its leader has charged that privatization would bring higher electric rates to meet the profit demands of foreign investors. the company principally provides electrical service to mexico city and the states of mexico, morelos, hidalgo and puebla. it may be prudent to begin planning for possible power shortages in these regions.

<320311, [vincent, we met last year when you were visiting the university, and talkingprimarily with our finance faculty.  as you may have heard, i tried to callto talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on realoptions from your group at enron.  naturally, i would be delighted if youcould speak, but i could also appreciate the possibility that someone elsemight also be a good choice.  i have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information.this is the first time this course has been offered at ut, and i wasmotivated to do so because of the "buzz" regarding the topic in industry.  ihave about 30 mba students in the class, many of whom were in the energyfinance classes offered by sheridan titman and ehud ronn (both of whom havebeen very supportive of the development of this class).  my own backgroundis decision analysis rather than finance, so i tend to approach the topicwith that perspective.  as you can see, i have covered both traditionaldecison analysis topics and a review of the options literature.  at thepresent time, i don t think there is a really complete textbook that fitsthe course at the mba level, so i ve tried to focus on how to do things inpractice, and have provided software (dpl, spreadsheets, @risk, etc) astools for the students to use. the course is scheduled on thursday afternoons from 3:30 to 6:30,which is a time that i chose to make possible the participation of someexecutive mba students from houston (3 are participating).  i look forwardto hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker, or any othersuggestions that you might have.james s. dyerfondren centennial chair in businessdepartment of management science and information systemscba 5.202the university of texas at austinaustin, texas 78712-1175email:  j.dyer@bus.utexas.edutelephone:  512-471-5278fax:  512-471-0587]>

"if you see a small, darklady with brown eyes and an apologetic expression, apparentlylooking for someone, would you please give her this?" he said.he then returned to his office content that, if a picture isworth a thousand words, then four photos must be a full-blownlecture!his wife saved those pictures. she carries them in her purse now.shows them to anyone who asks if she is married..how are you with patience? one person calls it "wait-training."it seems that there is always something we are waiting for. wewait on traffic and we wait in lines. we wait to hear about a newjob. we wait to complete school or to retire. we wait to grow upor for maturity in a child. we wait for a decision to be made. wewait for someone to change his or her mind.patience is an essential quality of a happy life. after all, somethings are worth waiting for. every day presents plenty ofopportunities for wait training. we can resent waiting, accept it or even get good at it! but onething is certain - we cannot avoid it. how is your wait trainingcoming along?]>

<349220, [all,attached is the lessons learned matrix developed from our meeting last week.  i want to thank everyone who participated.  there were some who wanted to attend but could not because of the ge integration efforts.  we missed you, but your interests were represented by people from your teams.  originally, the top 15 issues were identified and voted on by all functional teams.  during our session last week, three of these issues were combined, making the final list 12 issues.  the sub-issues, within each major issue, is labeled, for example, 1.1, with the root causes labelled 1.1.1.  dan lindquist did an outstanding job of facilitating our lessons learned process.  normally, we would have hired a third party facilitator, but due to cost constraints this was not possible; therefore, we utilized dan.  collectively dan and i developed this matrix.   as you will note, there are numerous global issues.  the plan is to coordinate a meeting with germany to discuss face to face all of our collective issues, so that improvements can be made for our mutual benefit. the plan is to develop a series of six sigma green belt projects from these issues, as a part of our six sigma training, which will come in the next week or so.  dan is already coordinating this with a geps six sigma black belt person from atlanta.  the plan is to assign two people to each "green belt project"; therefore, start thinking about which project you may want to be on.if i have missed anyone within your team, please forward on to them.  thanksbest regards,jeff]>

<357773, [thoughts on texas a&m...fox sports show host jim rome1)   they won t shut up. they have to go on about spirit, and old army,andred ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have intheir urine to beat ut, and blah blah blah. shut up. you start to get thefeeling the entire school was built to spite ut.2)   forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 spassed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have asubsidiary branch of the main school (university of texas) that would teachagriculture and mechanics. aggies love to say their school is older, fromwhere they get that i don t  now......the fact is, the state intended a&mto be a branch of ut. they are like the afterbirth fromthe originalcreation.  like danny devito in "twins".3)   so they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they mustdevotetheir entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good.all the while, nobody at ut denies that a&m is a good school, yet theywon t shut up. so they write a fight song......about?....texas, and howthey want to beat them. they have a fish camp for freshman where they tellthem how bad texas is and how good a&m and all its traditions are. it isthe world s largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested ineverything a&m does.4)   the people at a&m. now we all have friends who went to a&m or are ata&m.there are some nice people there. however...there is the corp.  east texas answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere. for every boy scout who neverlearned to stop playing with his gi joe toys, there is the corp. now,forget the fact that a&m will actually let people with sub-par gradesenroll if they agree to join the corp. forget the fact that the corpslooked like a gestapo hate rally while beating down students on kyle fieldin 1995. forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges thathave been filed against them, and swept under the rug over the years, theyjust this past month have had one corps member bring charges againstanother corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for alittle actual sodomy.  not only could i go on with more instances ofidiocracy by these khaki-clad-shaven-headed-dorks, i am sure each of youhave your own stories.the point is:we all respect west point, annapolis, the air force academy; however,nobody respects the corp. i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock ofthe military world. just because you dress like the army, and try and actlike the army, does not make you the army. people at a&m don t even respectthese clowns. it is not cool to shave your head and dress up. halloween isonly supposed to be one day of the year. if you want to carry guns and beatup civilians, move to israel.5)   it is even less cool to slobber on somebody s daughter on nationaltelevision and call it a tradition. dry humping 18 year old girls in thestands at football games is not cool. not only is it not cool, it should beagainst the law. i know that in college station, students are just prone tomount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytimeanything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you andstart sucking on her face. but everywhere else in the world, it is lookeddown upon. especially if you are doing it on my tv. that is why we havemoved the game from thanksgiving. because people across the nation weregagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game,some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody sthanksgiving dinner. we do not need to see burly women engaged in asuckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board.some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the cliniquecounter. screw that, forget make-up, it is too late for that, just givethem a veil.6)   "t.u." is not funny. it is not insulting. it is dumb. just imagine iffolks from texas kept talking about m&a and giggling. that would not befunny. in fact, it would be retarded. that s why ut fans don t do it.please learn.7)   you want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond ofsheep, of people that aren t stupid? then quit building things that falldown.quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv. quitwhooping in church. quit whooping period. quit putting up scoreboards forthe enjoyment of dead mammals. quit spending your friday nights practicinghow to yell. quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you re running forgovernor. when you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the formasks for your phone #, h & w, quit putting 258-3999, height 6 3", weight185.  just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. go to easttexas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th gradeeducation why they cheer for a&m and wear maroon. that is your fan base.this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid.8)   nobody cares if you think your band is better. they might be louder,they might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability. the point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. quit getting geeked up aboutmarching bands. i find it hard to believe you stood through your highschool band s entire halftime performance. and why? cause nobody cared thenand nobody cares now. plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if youdo care. why is it cool all of a sudden now that you re in college?9)   men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. perhaps theonlyjustifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during ananal probe. oh wait...i understand now.10)  dogs are not ladies. they don t look or smell like ladies. dogs eattheir own feces and should be treated accordingly.11)  finally, college station is an arm-pit of a town. quit pretending thatit is a great college town. it is a town and there is a college there.thatshould be the end of this comparison. if you feel that life doesn t get anybetter than the dixie chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending"dukes of hazard" episode, then move there. more importantly, don t move toaustin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and openminded population base. austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplaceand final resting place of all that is cool.as my friend stephen johnson once said: "if the world were ever to get anenema, college station is where you would connect the hose." if you go toschool at a&m, please don t be an aggie.god bless the great state of texas.brian pulssoftware engineerlockheed martin-enterprise solutions281 218-2740]>

<358545, [thoughts on texas a&m...fox sports show host jim rome1)   they won t shut up. they have to go on about spirit, and old army,andred ass, and how bonfire represents the burning sensation they have intheir urine to beat ut, and blah blah blah. shut up. you start to get thefeeling the entire school was built to spite ut.2)   forget the fact that when the texas legislature back in the 1870 spassed legislation to start a state university they also decided to have asubsidiary branch of the main school (university of texas) that would teachagriculture and mechanics. aggies love to say their school is older, fromwhere they get that i don t  now......the fact is, the state intended a&mto be a branch of ut. they are like the afterbirth fromthe originalcreation.  like danny devito in "twins".3)   so they apparently have this complex, so much so, that they mustdevotetheir entire school to trying to prove to ut that they are just as good.all the while, nobody at ut denies that a&m is a good school, yet theywon t shut up. so they write a fight song......about?....texas, and howthey want to beat them. they have a fish camp for freshman where they tellthem how bad texas is and how good a&m and all its traditions are. it isthe world s largest known case of penis envy, and it is manifested ineverything a&m does.4)   the people at a&m. now we all have friends who went to a&m or are ata&m.there are some nice people there. however...there is the corp.  east texas answer to dreams of rotc kids everywhere. for every boy scout who neverlearned to stop playing with his gi joe toys, there is the corp. now,forget the fact that a&m will actually let people with sub-par gradesenroll if they agree to join the corp. forget the fact that the corpslooked like a gestapo hate rally while beating down students on kyle fieldin 1995. forget the fact that along with the numerous hazing charges thathave been filed against them, and swept under the rug over the years, theyjust this past month have had one corps member bring charges againstanother corps member who apparently had been propositioning others for alittle actual sodomy.  not only could i go on with more instances ofidiocracy by these khaki-clad-shaven-headed-dorks, i am sure each of youhave your own stories.the point is:we all respect west point, annapolis, the air force academy; however,nobody respects the corp. i imagine they are kind of the laughing stock ofthe military world. just because you dress like the army, and try and actlike the army, does not make you the army. people at a&m don t even respectthese clowns. it is not cool to shave your head and dress up. halloween isonly supposed to be one day of the year. if you want to carry guns and beatup civilians, move to israel.5)   it is even less cool to slobber on somebody s daughter on nationaltelevision and call it a tradition. dry humping 18 year old girls in thestands at football games is not cool. not only is it not cool, it should beagainst the law. i know that in college station, students are just prone tomount each other on the campus lawn, or in the middle of class, or anytimeanything good happens you can just grab the girl sitting next to you andstart sucking on her face. but everywhere else in the world, it is lookeddown upon. especially if you are doing it on my tv. that is why we havemoved the game from thanksgiving. because people across the nation weregagging on their turkey when in the middle of watching a football game,some boy scout is tongue thrashing some overweight co-ed during somebody sthanksgiving dinner. we do not need to see burly women engaged in asuckfest every time your woeful offense manages to put points on the board.some of these girls are in desperate need of a trip to the cliniquecounter. screw that, forget make-up, it is too late for that, just givethem a veil.6)   "t.u." is not funny. it is not insulting. it is dumb. just imagine iffolks from texas kept talking about m&a and giggling. that would not befunny. in fact, it would be retarded. that s why ut fans don t do it.please learn.7)   you want to lose the image of country bumpkins, of a people fond ofsheep, of people that aren t stupid? then quit building things that falldown.quit chasing cheerleaders around with swords on national tv. quitwhooping in church. quit whooping period. quit putting up scoreboards forthe enjoyment of dead mammals. quit spending your friday nights practicinghow to yell. quit telling rape jokes to reporters when you re running forgovernor. when you are filling out season ticket renewals, and the formasks for your phone #, h & w, quit putting 258-3999, height 6 3", weight185.  just, collectively, stop making asses of yourselves. go to easttexas, tour every small town, and ask every red neck with a 5th gradeeducation why they cheer for a&m and wear maroon. that is your fan base.this is why you are perceived by the educated masses as stupid.8)   nobody cares if you think your band is better. they might be louder,they might march in neat little zig zags, but they have no musical ability. the point is, nobody cares who wins halftime. quit getting geeked up aboutmarching bands. i find it hard to believe you stood through your highschool band s entire halftime performance. and why? cause nobody cared thenand nobody cares now. plus, you can hear them fine sitting down even if youdo care. why is it cool all of a sudden now that you re in college?9)   men should never let out high pitched whooping sounds. perhaps theonlyjustifiable situation in which this can be tolerated is perhaps during ananal probe. oh wait...i understand now.10)  dogs are not ladies. they don t look or smell like ladies. dogs eattheir own feces and should be treated accordingly.11)  finally, college station is an arm-pit of a town. quit pretending thatit is a great college town. it is a town and there is a college there.thatshould be the end of this comparison. if you feel that life doesn t get anybetter than the dixie chicken, and enjoy being stuck in a never ending"dukes of hazard" episode, then move there. more importantly, don t move toaustin.....they are trying to create an educated, technological, and openminded population base. austin is, and will continue to be, the birthplaceand final resting place of all that is cool.as my friend stephen johnson once said: "if the world were ever to get anenema, college station is where you would connect the hose." if you go toschool at a&m, please don t be an aggie.god bless the great state of texas.brian pulssoftware engineerlockheed martin-enterprise solutions281 218-2740]>

<368360, [entelligence is being used in houston, so they must have done training here.  patti is setting up my meeting with james for friday.  i just left her a message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus i will leave you a message after i have talked with him.  i hope to have that meeting with james at 10:30.  interruptions have been rampant - and i am still not finished with reviews.  shona will actually be in calgary at the same time that i will be, so we will do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and i will tell her about the reorg.  again, i will leave you a message to let you know that we have had that conversation.  that s great to have dinner with lou.  i think that it would be good to find out from him what sort of interaction he has with the london office, what s working, what s not working - in an informal way.  are they on an enron network?  do they get enron e:mails?  how often does lou go to london or someone from london mid office come to new york?  i still suspect that new york is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between london and new york and the fact that there seems to be plenty for mike and his team to chew on in london.  particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal business.  enrjoy the oprisk conference.  they tend to be heavily attended by bankers and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can glean from what they are doing.  it snowed there a lot yesterday.  of course, according to peggy hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy in calgary.  i look forward to seeing you in dallas.  --sally beth apollo02/06/2001 04:28 pmto: sally beck/hou/ect@ectcc:  subject: re: entelligence training  will start to check into this.  i would like to see the training, so i can get familiar with the product.  have they delivered it in houston at all?thanks for the heads up on james for friday.  i will be in ny at the conference, but at least that clears the way for me to start getting busy when we get back from the ase on wed.i am having dinner with lou colorusso, one of the metals guys in ny on thursday night.   marcello declined.  any issues you think i should discuss with him?

and in each case the political and technical authorities made a bet that they could manage discredited practices. and, in each case, they failed, thereby visiting great suffering on their populations.the precipitating event of the argentine debacle was an overvalued and, ultimately, untenable exchange rate. the convertibility scheme adopted in 1991 was brilliant in its simplicity. by assuring the public that enough dollars were to be held in official reserves to cover the monetary base and thereby guarantee that pesos could be exchanged for dollars, on demand, even a skeptical public found the approach credible. runaway inflation was stopped in its tracks. overall economic growth rates soared, at least for a while. the technique was a variant of the mexican experiment that began in 1987: using the exchange rate as the anchor to defeat inflation.what "did in" the argentine experiment was the appreciation of the u.s. dollar. this led, inevitably under one-to-one convertibility, to the appreciation of the argentine peso, and despite the preaching of ideologues that it is immoral to alter an exchange rate, the price of a country s money-its exchange rate-does affect its exports and imports. on top of this, brazil devalued its currency, the real, in 1999, and what argentina faced was the appreciation of its currency while that of the country that took one-third of its exports depreciated. argentina nevertheless retained the overvalued exchange rate and, in the process, further destroyed the country s competitive position. inflation was kept in check, but the country has suffered economic downturn ever since.this description omits other aspects of argentina s economic, political, and social situation. these include relatively modest fiscal deficits (the public sector borrowing requirement averaged about 2 percent of gdp between 1991 and 1998, at the national and provincial levels combined); growing social inequality and poverty; too many feckless politicians who looked at government service as a source of enrichment; and reckless borrowing, public and private, domestic and foreign. argentina met its debt obligations by more borrowing, but this was a large ponzi scheme because the inability to earn enough foreign exchange from exports meant that the rigid one-to-one structure had to collapse, sooner or later.mexico, in 1987, adopted a form of price controls, under what was called a pacto de solidaridad, to lower its inflation. the pacto, or agreement, called for the private sector to limit price increases, labor to limit wage demands, and the government to control its expenditures. when the pacto started, mexico devalued its currency sharply to leave room for appreciation of the peso in order to prevent devaluation from raising inflation. the pactos were kept in place, with annual modifications, from 1987 through 1994. the anchor for mexico s anti-inflation policy was an increasingly overvalued peso. inflation declined gradually, year after year, rather than abruptly as it did in argentina after convertibility, but economic growth in mexico in these years was modest.as in argentina, the mexican political authorities (the president) and the technicians (the finance minister, with the cooperation of the head of the central bank) were unwilling to change the exchange-rate structure, a form of crawling peg. instead, they took the risk that they could delay devaluation until some time in the future. there was general agreement that the mexican peso was overvalued, and the way the authorities dealt with this in foreign borrowing was to issue short-term notes that had a dollar guarantee-the so-called tesobonos. this house of cards collapsed in december 1994, about three weeks after the previous president left office. the mexican authorities gambled, and the population lost.as in argentina, there were other elements in the mexican collapse. there were assassinations of political leaders during 1994; the u.s. federal reserve raised the federal funds rate six times during the year, seriously affecting mexico; the government budget was kept in balance, but development banks were allowed to provide uncollected credit that amounted to some 3 percent of gdp; political corruption continued much as before; and foreign borrowing, on short terms and at dollar equivalents, rose sharply even as official reserves declined from capital flight and efforts to support the exchange rate. in the end, however, what did mexico in was an overvalued exchange rate that was kept in place far too long.in the case of brazil, the scenario unfolded differently. the real plan was put in place in mid-1994 in an effort to reduce inflation without burdening economic growth. as in mexico, in brazil the stable exchange rate worked and inflation was reduced. brazil weathered the tequila effect of december 1994, when the mexican peso depreciated, without any sharp change in the real plan. however, brazil was hit sharply by the aftereffects of the russian debt default in 1998 because investors either had to cover positions or became nervous about keeping capital in brazil given its precarious situation. in january 1999, brazil devalued the real and took other corrective measures. brazil did not have the turmoil that either mexico or argentina faced when they were forced to devalue under the most adverse circumstances. brazil acted more quickly, before a deepening crisis made action exceedingly costly.the currencies of brazil and mexico are both floating, and thus far, the mechanism is working. argentina has announced that it will allow its currency to float for domestic transactions but that it will be controlled for foreign trade. that is, argentina will have a dual exchange- rate system, justified by the assertion that because the one-to-one structure was in effect for so long, the country needed six months for moving to a single, floating currency. argentina s new president, eduardo duhalde, has also stated that the country s opening to imports has been a disaster and that trade policy will become more nationalistic (protectionist).at this point, two comments. dual exchange rates have a history of failure, especially by abetting corruption. argentina has tried protectionism before, especially under juan per?n, and it did little other than to increasingly impoverish the country. in the interest of argentina s future, one can only hope that the dual exchange-rate system does not last very long and that the economic nationalism will not be too severe.the deeper issue is to ask why government leaders pursue policies that have a history of failures. this is a task for psychologists, not economists, but i will give it a try.		?	it is politically unpopular to devalue a currency; therefore, why not push off the unpleasantness for as long as possible? the suffering for doing this will come later, perhaps on someone else s watch.?	memories are short-those of the politicians and technicians who repeat past mistakes, and of the general public. in addition, memories often gild the past, forgetting that latin america s poverty and inequality were created during periods of past protectionism.?	intelligent leaders become wedded to policies they put in place and are often emotionally unable to change what they have been doing. domingo cavallo was fabulously successful as economics minister in argentina in the early part of the 1990s and dismally incorrect in his actions when he returned in the de la r?a government in the same position. in mexico, in 1994, both president salinas and finance minister pedro aspe were so adamant about not devaluing the peso that they excluded technicians from policy deliberations when they did not agree with this position.it is understandable that many analysts and business leaders prefer fixed exchange rates. when things are going well, this provides a degree of certainty. however, the time to judge the effectiveness of an exchange-rate mechanism is when the system is under pressure. this explains the attractiveness of floating exchange rates for countries prone to economic shocks. it is clear from what is happening in argentina and what took place in mexico in 1994 that fixed rates-even a relatively hard fix of the type that argentina had-can spell disaster when a country is under economic pressure. perhaps this lesson will stick-at least for a time.issues in international political economy is produced by the william e. simon chair in political economy at the center for strategic and international studies (csis), a private, tax-exempt institution focusing on international public policy issues. its research is nonpartisan and nonproprietary.csis does not take specific policy positions. accordingly, all views, positions, and conclusions expressed in this publication should be understood to be solely those of the author.? 2002 by the center for strategic and international studies.]>

<404439, [good morning,last tuesday i attended the oati training on e-tag 1.7 in houston.  although this new tagging won t be implemented until march, we will have access to the test site sometime in november or december.this new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each group that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice.  also, because the format of the new tags is so different, the old templates will not work.  new templates will need to be created.please let me know if you want to have formal training sessions, and i will work up a series of them for january and february.thanks,cara]>
