(ii) blm s mar=ginal costs are among highest in panama.  a preliminary strategy has been m=apped out; and (iii) ppa terms are a bit "one-sided" in favor of the distri=butor.  blm and other market participants have tried repeatedly to get the =distco to change terms without success. =20=20dominican republic:  el paso confirmed it can t work with us.  operationall=y, the plant is working well.  as noted on an earlier e-mail, efi s fuel su=pplier for seclp, vitol, asked for a letter of credit or pre-payment terms.=  enron rejected the request.  seclp bought cargo directly from vitol.  we =are working closely with tom moran of ene credit on these issues.=20ecoelectrica:this week was a very productive week.  update as follows:  lender process: = based on several conversations this week, lenders have stated they underst=and that mirant s insurance package is the result of market conditions.  le=nders are prepared to pursue credit committee approval with the $300 millio=n coverage.  mirant offered a 6-month only waiver on the deductibles.  lend=ers appear content with that option.  ene insurance has approximately 75% o=f the underwriters on board with our back-up plan to provide the additional= $200 million tranche.  backup will be used only if credit committee(s) kic=k back existing coverage.  mirant to issue a certification of compliance wi=th qf (by eco) and a legal opinion asap.  based on the progress this week a=nd the remaining commitment on deliverables, it is expected that the lender= s agent can put together the entire lender package and submit it to the le=nder group by tuesday of next week.  finally, mirant also committed to prov=iding comments (if any) to the lender consent agreement.  ene and eme have =reviewed and provided comments already.  ge consent:  mirant committed to s=ending their "versions" of the key documents on the ge buy-out on friday ni=te (late).  i have not seen the document but they have repeatedly stated th=at the documents are "conforming".  union carbide guarantee:  plan to final=ize language early next week.  schedule:  mirant has committed to fulfillin=g cp s as early as possible (and is acting on that statement) as long as we= can allow them to fund on 12/19.  they state they are confident they can c=lose cp s by earlier than 12/14 and can fund on 12/19.  csfb has not shed l=ight on the apparent funding (timing) limitation but has offered to investi=gate further. =20=20apachi =20=20philippines: the team did an excellent job of advancing discussions and neg=otiations with npc but was unable to move the slow government machinery fas=t enough to make it to a signing by last thursday s new york event.  nevert=heless, momentum is high and team continues to work toward a 12/15 agreemen=t date;

floyd, jodie; ratliff, dalesubject:	re: from the gas logistics  weekly report:gary - for the time being would you work with george marshall to send myself and jodie floyd an email if he identifies a potential efm problem on the nng north or south end.    we will log the ticket as a "hot seat" entry.   he will need to give us a little description - meter number and the tech s name and location for the log entry purposes.  you can see that mike wants to document and track all efm issues and would like himself and his directors to be aware of the problems that could affect the customer s measurement and affect uaf & ppas.   as we originally discussed,  this can only be done if all efm problems are funneled through the measurement desk.by following such a process we can log and track the ticket to resolution when the volumes are correct in gms.  george does all the database work and most of the notification of measurement problems.   we don t want to duplicate efforts while george is still here but we need to get the issues tracked in the log that will be sent to nng & market services management,  measurement specialist,  measurement operations, nng marketing,  gas control it  &  nng field operations. george does a great job and we are doing our best to not disrupt his daily routine by duplicating efforts but we need him to keep us in the loop on potential measurement issues on any nng station, north or south.    if we need to follow up on the status of volumetric issues we will contact the tech.   it would be good if george would give us updates on physical/software repairs.   angela has set him up to get into the nng measurement log and he could make his own nng entries & updates early in the morning before jodie arrives at 7 am..   that is up to him.  he can actually get in the log anytime he wants by letting jodie know he wants to make entries.   i was told that george would be retiring the end of the year.  once george retires then we will start doing the notifications on the nng efm custody transfer collection issues.  but in the mean time we need some help to make this nng efm effort work.tks - mike w.  -----original message-----from: 	kenagy, gary  sent:	tuesday, july 24, 2001 11:19 amto:	wagoner, michael;

of =100 local communities with approximately 500,000  energy customers. under t=he agreement, green mountain energy will construct a  25-kilowatt solar arr=ay at lake farmpark in kirtland, ohio, and will conduct a  study to determi=ne the feasibility of siting a wind generating facility in ohio.  the green= mountain energy solar array will be the largest in the state and the  firs=t commercial

in  oklahomaoak ridge national laboratory (ornl) has reported, in a  first-of-its kind =study, that restructuring oklahoma s electric industry can  benefit consume=rs, but problems and potential pitfalls do exist. the report has  been met =with some opposition however. pete churchwell, president of oklahoma s  sec=ond largest electric utility aep/pso, stated on november 16th that he does = not support the study s findings, one of which indicates that oklahoma s e=nergy  costs could rise between 5 and 25 percent if the retail electricity =market is  opened to competition. the study results indicate that lower ele=ctric prices may  be available in the short term, but restructuring will ul=timately bring higher  prices. under the state s restructuring plan, existi=ng generating plants will  have a competitive advantage over new plants. th=is advantage will result in  higher prices in the long term because newer, =higher-cost plants may be forced  out of the marketplace. churchwell contes=ts that it is too early to know for  certain how consumer rates will react =in a deregulated market. while admitting  that the nation s grid was not de=signed for retail competition, churchwell said  that improvements in state =transmission systems would allow a successful retail  competitive market.utility still looks to be freed of  generatorsclark public utilities has been trying in vain for  two months to unload so=me of the 50 portable generators that have become a  multimillion-dollar wh=ite elephant.  the units, wired in rows near the  river road generating pla=nt, were leased for a year for $19.5 million. the deal  was signed with gen=eral electric early this year, at a time when there were dire  predictions =about this summer s power supply.  in addition to the equipment  lease, the=re is a $15 million natural gas contract to power the generators and a  rou=ghly $12 million expense to transport the gas. while clark has been able to=  resell some of the gas at a loss, the transportation costs can t be  reco=uped.  for weeks, electricity on the open market has been much cheaper  tha=n that produced by the generators.  in place since july, the generators,  e=ach producing 1 megawatt of power, have run for just 39 days.  electricity = prices have plunged, from a high of $325 per megawatt-hour this summer to =less  than $30 today. the price has to be about $95 to make operating the g=enerators  feasible. so utility officials have had no choice but to let the=m sit  idle.  in september, the net expense for the generator farm gas, gen=erator  lease and so on was $3.5 million. for no electricity.  utility offi=cials  have tried to get ge to find customers for at least some of the  gen=erators.  tuesday morning, andy huck, clark s operations director, said  he= had heard from ge about a "pretty serious inquiry" for two generators for =two  months. and that, he said, "is the best inquiry they ve had so far."  =now,  utility officials are trying to decide whether to keep spending $62,0=00 a month  for three ge employees and other expenses associated with maint=aining the  generators.  the theory is that the equipment should be tested,= a few at a  time, to ensure they will be ready if needed.  "they told me t=he generators  need to be  exercised, " said huck. "i told them they spent =two months on a ship  without being started." the units were built in austr=ia.  ge, with a signed  one-year lease in hand, has little incentive to fin=d customers for the  equipment, particularly when the company could presuma=bly lease other generators  from its inventory.  "they say it s because we =re such good client" that an  effort has been made to find other users for =the generators, said huck. clark s  $120 million river road generating plan=t features a giant ge turbine.   clark officials don t hold out much hope o=f getting out from under the generator  lease expense, which runs about $1.=3 million per month. "where would they go?"  asked jim sanders, clark s dir=ector of energy resources.  meanwhile, the  natural gas supply for the equi=pment is being resold at about half what it cost  the utility. gas prices a=lso have fallen since the supply deal was inked.   at their regular tuesday= meeting, utility commissioners decided to proceed with  a $100 million bon=d sale that includes money to pay for the generator  lease.  in march, rick= dyer, clark s finance director, recommended that the  utility cut a deal f=or a one-year, $100 million "bond anticipation note." the  arrangement was =made on the assumption that interest rates would fall in a few  months, whi=ch they have to 1961 levels.  the move tuesday gave dyer and  utility gener=al manager wayne nelson the ok to approve a bond sale of up to 15  years at= 6 percent interest although 5 percent or less is more likely, and the  goa=l is a 10-year term, officials said.  the bond sale likely will occur in  t=he first week of december. the bulk of the $100 million borrowing is to cov=er a  $63 million power purchase from kaiser aluminum. the deal, like the g=enerator  lease, was for power to cover an august-september gap in clark s =power supply,  before the start of a bonneville power administration contra=ct.  that  kaiser purchase was at $325 a megawatt-hour. the utility lost a =bid to have a  federal judge declare the price exorbitant and order a parti=al refund.    =20aep, reliant named as last resort  providers in texasthe texas public utility commission (puc) has  named american electric powe=r (aep) and reliant resources affiliates "providers  of last resort" (polr)= for residential and small-commercial customers in all or  part of 96 count=ies within txu electric s service area. the polr becomes the  electricity p=rovider for customers who have been dropped by their past provider  due to =payment problems or if their provider has discontinued service in their s  =area. aep and reliant will offer a retail price that is expected to be 30-3=4  percent higher than base rates in the area taking effect january 1, 2002=. by  becoming the polr, aep and reliant will acquire an additional 2 milli=on  dallas-area customers and an expected 1-20 percent load increase. due t=o the  higher costs associated with such an increased load the puc was agre=eable to the  higher rate. consumer groups are opposing the higher rates, s=aying that  low-income consumers will be unfairly hurt. although many low-i=ncome consumers  will qualify for a 10 percent discount advocates are argui=ng that polr rates  should equal the regular rates.studies show changing consumer views  towards deregulationa recent study by deloitte and touche  energy resources group finds that co=nsumers are less aware of deregulation in  the electric industry and more w=ary of its potential benefits. the survey  considered the opinions of 657 c=onsumers nationwide and found that the number of  consumers who are aware o=f changes in retail electric markets has dropped to  39.7 percent, compared= with 50.5 percent in 2000. this is a reversal in a  five-year trend of inc=reasing consumer awareness on deregulation. analysts cited  the terrorist a=ttacks and the lack of federal legislation or debate on  deregulation as re=asons for the change. the survey also found that more  consumers expect ele=ctric rates to increase with deregulation. deloitte and  touche s brank ter=zi reports that a third of consumers expect no benefit from  competition, w=hile 26 percent expect prices to go down, 9 percent expect  improved servic=e, and 15 percent simply "don t know." another study completed by  rks rese=arch and consulting similarly found that many consumers feel that  "deregul=ation has been a colossal failure." their study found that many  consumers =who have switched to new service providers have been disappointed  because =their service expectations were not met. rks senior vice president  carmine= grastataro said, "customers of public power are more satisfied with the  j=ob their utility is doing than are customers of the ious. although this fin=ding  has historically remained true, the difference in performance scores =between  public power and ious is exacerbated in states where competition i=s under way."  the study also found that consumers are more interested in p=urchasing power  through buying groups, voluntary energy curtailment progra=ms, and on-site  generation.ferc postpones december 15 rto  deadlinethe federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) has  officially decided to =postpone the december 15, 2001, deadline for utilities to  create four regi=onal transmission organizations (rto). ferc chairman pat wood  said of the =decision, "rto development is in very different stages in various  parts of= the country, and it is not possible for all rtos to be in operation by  th=e december 15, 2001, deadline established in order 2000." the commission ha=s  approved a rulemaking order, rm01-12, that addresses the development of =rtos in  several steps. first, the commission will develop a broader defini=tion of the  expected functions of an rto and how they can be achieved. sec=ond, ferc will  seek improved input and communication from both state and f=ederal agencies on  rto development. third, ferc will conduct a formal cost= benefit analysis of rto  systems. this comes in response to two conflictin=g studies: ny iso reports that  a large northeast rto could cause power rat=es to increase by $90 million, while  mirant contends that a northeast rto =could save consumers $440 million. the  rulemaking also calls for ferc to d=etermine areas in which standardization can  be improved. lastly, a new "pr=ogressive" timeline will be developed that  addresses rto development in a =region-by-region approach. while chairman wood  said that the commission is= holding to its original concept of four rtos, he  also noted that the new =order suggests that three smaller rtos may be developed  within the western= region. these transmission groups would include rto west,  desert star rto=, and one based on the california iso. the rulemaking also makes  a call fo=r comments in what commissioner nora brownell noted as possibly the  last o=pportunity for market participants and state regulators to make  suggestion=s and raise concerns before final orders are issued.ontario deregulation in  doubt=20the planned  deregulation of the $35-billion ontario electricity sector has= been thrown in  doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the provinc=e s electricity  transmission company, preventing it from becoming a signif=icant player in an  open north american power market. the plan, known only =to ontario premier mike  harris and a few government and bay street insider=s, would turn hydro one into a  not-for-profit entity instead of a fully co=mmercial, privatized company. if this  happens, hydro one would lack the fl=exibility to raise equity capital, make  acquisitions and form partnerships= in an effort to become one of continent s  premier transmission companies =-- a goal plainly set out by chief executive  officer eleanor clitheroe. da=vid lindsay, the president and chief executive  officer of ontario superbui=ld corp., the government s privatization adviser,  confirmed that turning h=ydro one into a not-for-profit organization, similar to  nav canada, the ci=vil air navigation service, is under serious consideration.  "we ve been as=ked to evaluate all options for hydro one s future, including this  one," h=e said yesterday. he would not provide details, though it is thought that  =the government wants to make a decision on hydro one s future ownership  st=ructure by the conclusion of the year. a senior official in the ontario  go=vernment, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal "is a step  =backward to the old days of ontario hydro." he was referring to the debt-la=den  utility that was split into ontario power generation, the electricity =generating  arm, and hydro one, whose network of high-voltage transmission =lines spans  30,000 kilometres. the premier s office would not comment. a s=pokeswoman for  energy minister jim wilson would say only that "there are a= number of options on  the table." sources on bay street and at queen s par=k said the idea of turning  hydro one into a not-for-profit entity is being= propelled by anthony fell, the  chairman of royal bank-owned rbc dominion =securities, bay street s largest  dealer. if the new hydro one took this sh=ape, it would raise about $10-billion  through the sale of bonds to investo=rs. the dealers  commission on the sale of  the bonds, which would rank amo=ng the biggest debt issues in history, would  range from $25-million to $40=-million, one bay street executive said. mr. harris  is said to be keen on =the concept partly because all the money would go back to  the government t=o help pay down the $21-billion in "stranded debt" racked up by  the old on=tario hydro. the generating and transmission giant s decades-long  spending= spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the  province= s balance sheet. hydro one s cash flow, derived from sales to  electricity= users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of  bonds. pre=sumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if hydro one  lack=ed sufficient cash to pay the interest. if hydro one were a private company=  instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayer=s. the  united states has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts th=e financial  risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders.= executives at rbc  dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client= confidentiality  concerns. mr. fell first proposed it to the government in= the spring. the  government wants to open up the ontario electricity marke=t, in which buyers and  sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. the m=arket overhaul contemplated  turning ontario power generation and hydro one=, both of which are 100 per cent  owned by the government, into commercial =companies. in hydro one s case, the  leading options were thought to be an =outright sale, in which the utility would  be bought by another company (pr=esumably a rival utility), or an initial public  offering, where the shares= would be owned by private investors and traded on the  stock exchange. the= third option -- converting hydro one into a not-for-profit  organization -=- has come as a surprise. there has been no debate on this option,  though =rumours of its existence have jolted bay street and hydro one, both of  whi=ch were working on the assumption that the transmission business would  eve=ntually become a commercial enterprise. sources said that hydro one  manage=ment opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny hydro one  =the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. the  not-f=or-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises=  potential trade issues with the united states. american transmission comp=anies  might argue that hydro one s non-taxable status gives it an unfair c=ompetitive  advantage. it would also deny hydro one management the benefit =of potentially  lucrative share options.  rod taylor, hydro one s executive= vice-president,  would not comment on the not-for-profitoption being conte=mplated by the  government. he said, however, that the company s strategy h=inges on its ability  to become a major player in the deregulated north ame=rican electricity market.  "our vision of the company is to become a fully =commercial entity, and become in  the transmission sector what canadian nat=ional is to the rail sector," he said  in a phone interview. stanley hartt,= the chairman of the canadian office of wall  street s salomon smith barney=, is among the bay street executives who opposes a  not-for-profit structur=e for hydro one (salomon has a small role as an adviser  to hydro one s str=ategic business plan). in a three-page letter sent this week  to the top ex=ecutives of several large power-using ontario companies, he said  that "thi=s idea is short-sighted and bad for ontario." he argued that "the  absence =of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit  corp=oration essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers." he also  =said that, without financial flexibility, hydro one would lack the resource=s to  invest in "new bottleneck-eliminating connections" that would allow t=he company  to become a significant electricity exporter. "ontario would lo=se the prospect  of becoming a true hub for north american energy transmiss=ion," he said. in a  recent report on the power industry, td newcrest analy=st david mccracken wrote,  "with its operating expertise and strong balance= sheet, hydro one is well  positioned to act as a consolidator of transmiss=ion grids in the northern united  states, where ownership tends to be fragm=ented." he noted that hydro one is  expected to be privatized in the next f=ew years, and he said the utility has  "the opportunity to lever strengths =from traditional wires businesses into  competitive high-growth initiatives=." according to sources familiar with the  not-for-profit proposal, hydro o=ne would be governed in the best interests of  all electricity users by sto=cking the board of directors with appointees from  corporations that are he=avy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper  companies. such a= structure exists at nav canada, with airline executives on the  board, and= the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers.  restructu=ring hydro one with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the  mos=t efficient way to capitalize the company. "the problem with a canadian  na=tional rail-style ipo is that equity is much more expensive than debt," sai=d  one financier familiar with the proposal. "with a debt-based structure, =every  dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based st=ructure  means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and =make debt  payments." dofasco inc., the big ontario steel producer that con=sumes about  $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profi=t proposal. gord  forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would =reduce ontario hydro s  stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving th=e way for lower electricity  charges. currently, a special levy on all elec=tricity bills is being used to  whittle down the debt. the charge costs dof=asco alone about $15-million a year.  "we want to see the stranded debt pai=d down first," mr. forstner said. "until  that happens, we don t favour hyd=ro one going to the expense of expanding  outside of ontario s boundaries."retail access requested in  californiathe alliance for retail energy markets (arem) has  asked the california sup=reme court to overturn the state public utilities  commission s september 2=0th decision that suspended direct retail access across  the state. the con=sumer group, comprised of american utility network, the  alliance for retai=l energy markets, california league of food processors,  western power trad=ing forum, strategic energy, ab&i foundry, tricon global  restaurants and s=chool project for utility rate reduction, has argued that the  ruling was m=ade without due process and that the court had no right to abrogate  contra=cts retroactively. "it is our hope that the supreme court recognizes the  p=uc has acted in complete disregard of our constitutional rights and has rus=hed  to judgment on this issue, without hearings and without creating a pro=per  evidentiary record," said arem attorney dan douglass. puc commissioner= carl wood  has maintained that the puc issued the order because it believe=d that consumers  have hastily signed contracts with competitive suppliers,= leaving fewer  customers to pay for the state s wholesale power costs. are=m is disputing the  claim, saying that only a limited number of customers s=witched suppliers during  the summer of 2001.plant construction influences  florida s wholesale marketcalifornia based calpine corporation  announced that it has begun construct=ion of a 530 megawatt power plant in  auburndale, florida. the construction= brings florida closer to deregulation, as  calpine is one of the few out-o=f-state generating companies to successfully  penetrate florida s wholesale= electricity market. other companies, such as  enron, have attempted to con=struct new power plants in the state, but have been  unsuccessful due to co=mmunity and regulatory resistance. florida s stringent  power plant siting =act makes it very difficult for out-of-state companies to  enter the market=. calpine has succeeded by agreeing to sell the output from the  auburndale= plant under a long-term contract to one of florida s existing  utilities, =seminole electric cooperative. in addition, calpine has been working  with =the florida partnership for affordable competitive electricity to persuade = lawmakers and governor bush to deregulate florida s wholesale market. flor=ida s  energy 2020 study commission, which is responsible for the state s c=ompetition  plan, has endorsed a proposal to allow out-of-state companies t=o enter florida s  wholesale market by building new plants and selling powe=r to the state s  incumbent utilities. the commission has also suggested el=iminating the power of  state government to approve power plant development= and limiting the ability of  local governments to block projects. the comm=ission is expected to issue a final  report on december 1, 2001.florida psc approves independent  power line operationsthe florida public service commission  (psc) has approved the transfer of t=he state s power lines from utility  jurisdiction to an independent company=. the psc has asked florida s three main  utilities, florida power and ligh=t (fpl), florida and power corporation, and  tampa electric, to devise a pr=oposal within 90 days that will turn over  operation of the power lines to =an independent system operator. commissioner  michael a. palecki said that =the decision was made in the best interest for  ratepayers, utility compani=es and independent power companies seeking a  competitive market. under an =earlier proposal submitted to the psc, the  utilities proposed a statewide =regional transmission organization, gridflorida,  that would have owned and= managed the power lines. the psc did not approve the  plan, as it would ha=ve moved jurisdiction of retail rates to the federal energy  regulatory com=mission.new england congressmen seek equal  representation on rto boardtwenty-three u.s. congressmen from  new england requested that their states= be given adequate representation on the  governance of the northeast regio=nal transmission organization (rto.) in an  effort organized by representat=ive edward markey (d-mass), the bipartisan  delegation of congressmen wrote= a letter to the federal energy regulatory  commission (ferc) asking the re=gulators to create a governing board comprised of  equal numbers of represe=ntatives from new england, new york, and the  mid-atlantic. "we view an equ=ally balanced governance structure as the only way  in which a single marke=t design can be implemented which would truly benefit the  consumers of all= the regions," markey said. ferc has been considering several  options for =structuring the board that will oversee the unified northeast  wholesale po=wer market. one proposal gives five seats for representatives from  the mid=-atlantic, three seats to new york, and two to new england. iso new  englan=d and new york independent system operator joined the congressman in  oppos=ing that plan and requesting equal representation.california wants consumers to see  real power costsin a move that may prevent a repeat meltdown of  the wholesale electricity =market in california, the california consumer power  and financing authorit=y wants to install electricity meters that charge  consumers the real cost =of power. currently consumers pay the same price for  electricity throughou=t the day even though the wholesale price varies every  hour. therefore, co=nsumers have no incentive to conserve during peak times. the  meters will c=harge residential consumers more for power used during peak hours,  when de=mand is highest and less during off peak times. the authority issued  reque=sts for proposals, due by november 15, for a minimum of 10,000 real-time  m=eters, the cost of which varies between $200 and $1,000. the power authorit=y  plans to finance the purchase of the meters and will market them to cust=omers of  pacific gas & electric, southern california edison, san diego gas= &  electric and dozens of municipal utilities. as consumers have shown to =be  responsive to price signals in a pilot program in washington, californi=ans too  can expect to reduce their energy consumption. project manger, kev=in wood of  southern california edison hopes his company will install meter=s for 11,000  customers by next summer. he said that if these customers, wh=o represent 20 to  30 percent of the load, respond to price signals during =peak hours, this may in  turn drive down wholesale prices for all users. wh=ile consumers may benefit, the  decrease in consumption may cost power gene=rators millions of dollars in  revenue.environmentalists and union coalition  oppose deregulation in indianaa coalition of union members from  several groups showed their opposition t=o electric utility deregulation in  indiana during a peaceful demonstration= on november 7. the coalition, know as  people s energy campaign, includes =members from unite local 399, formerly the  ladies garment workers union, t=he central labor council, valley watch  environmental group, and the citize=ns action coalition. denny owen, an executive  board member of unite local =399, expressed the general concern of the coalition  that deregulation shou=ld be discouraged. "we don t think it ll make prices  lower, it ll make the=m go higher," owen said. indiana is considered to have low  utility rates c=ompared to other states. indiana lawmakers are considering  deregulation as= newly introduced legislation proposes to create an energy policy  commissi=on that would craft a comprehensive energy plan for the state. senator  gar=d and other general assembly members created the bill to address the state =s  need for a true energy policy and as a means to address future electric =load  growth. "merchant power plants have been a divisive issue in the past= year and a  half," gard said. "there are many people who feel if the state= has a  comprehensive energy policy, it might be better able to deal with t=his issue.  and we also have to pay attention to what s happened in califor=nia." the bill  would set up a temporary commission with appointed members =representing various  stakeholder groups including state government, indust=ry, labor, and  environmental groups. the commission is scheduled to presen=t a final report to  the governor in december 2002. while electric deregula=tion would not be a prime  focus of the commission, the "specter of deregul=ation" would have to be examined  in some fashion, senator gard said. sb 23=3 has been sent to the senate rules and  legislative procedures committee. =senator gard predicts it will pass the senate,  although chances in the hou=se of representatives are less favorable.debate over oklahoma transmission  system s readiness to serve future loadthe electric  restructuring advisory committee met with industry officials =on november 7 to  discuss the future capabilities of oklahoma s transmissio=n system. the committee  is responsible for researching the capabilities of= the system, determining  whether upgrades are necessary, and delegating th=e responsibility for paying for  such upgrades. with new power plants being= developed and proposals to open the  state to a competitive electric marke=t in progress, concern has risen as to  whether the transmission system can= handle the increased load. stanton hadley of  oak ridge national laborator=y reported that electricity demand in oklahoma is  expected to grow 26 perc=ent, to 14,350 megawatts by 2010. the transmission  system currently is abl=e to handle only 13,300 megawatts. nevertheless, power  companies are plann=ing 13,500 megawatts of new power generation. calpine  corporation is spend=ing about $20 million on transmission improvements between  its power plant= near coweta, oklahoma, and the outlying region. also, public  service comp=any of oklahoma plans to spend $40 million on transmission upgrades  over t=he next few years. with the new power plants and a supply surplus  expected=, hadley also said that consumers could expect lower costs. john wright,  o=ne of the committee members questioning this assumption, said that in a  de=regulated market, the utilities are likely to sell their power out of state=.  if this were to occur, lower power prices would be unlikely. the electri=c  restructuring advisory committee will deliver a report to the legislatur=e at the  end of the year.thirty new power plants proposed for  virginiathe latest news out of the deregulation of virginia s  electric power indus=try centers around thirty proposals for new power plants in  the state. whi=le the surge in supply is expected to prevent a california-like  energy cri=sis, health and environmentalists argue that the air pollution and  smog fr=om the plants could damage the state s parks and forests. since 1998,  when= the state announced its plans to open its energy markets to competition, 3=0  companies and utilities have asked for state approval to build new plant=s.  activists complain that the new power would not even benefit virginia s=  customers, as the energy is intended for delivery in northeastern states.= by  building plants in virginia, utilities avoid the northeast s stringent=  environmental regulations. an advisory group composed of utility and indu=stry  representatives argues that new plants pose no significant risk. they= stated  that 28 of the new plants would run on cleaner-burning natural gas= and that  other federal regulations would require older plants to reduce h=armful emissions  by 65 percent by 2004. the representatives also expect th=at only a few of the  plants will actually be built due to market condition=s and cooling-water  shortages.copyright ? 2001 egnatia research &  management. all rights  reserved15997.53 433 64749.26 473.13 50615.52 341.85

"should an inadvertent loss of primary heat =transport coolant occur,  operator response could be delayed, resulting in =a loss of core cooling." more  than 2,500 nuclear-plant modifications were =not incorporated into design  manuals, leading to confusion about how the p=lant actually runs. there was a  backlog in preventive and corrective maint=enance and some maintenance work was  poorly done. wano tried to block the =globe s access to the report, which listed  dozens of other sloppy practice=s at the bruce facility, and a second related  report that found troubling =safety lapses at the pickering nuclear station. but  the organization recen=tly abandoned a court challenge seeking to have the  documents remain confi=dential. it is the first time wano reports assessing the  performance of nu=clear plants have been publicly released anywhere in the world.  a bruce st=ation official said its performance has improved dramatically since  the cr=itical report was written. wano now considers bruce "one of the fastest  im=proving nuclear plants in north america," said duncan hawthorne, chief  exe=cutive officer at the site. one nuclear energy critic said concerns raised =in  the report about possible loss of cooling -- an interruption in the flo=w of  water that keeps a reactor from overheating -- describes an event tha=t could  cause a serious mishap by allowing unwanted nuclear chain reaction=s. "it could  result in some form of criticality accident, which could even=tually lead to a  meltdown," said david martin, a nuclear safety consultant= with the sierra club  of canada. the globe and mail requested the reports =under ontario s freedom of  information act in 1999. both ontario power and= wano opposed the releases.  ontario power argued that public knowledge of =the reports would jeopardize its  finances and increase the cost of its lia=bility insurance. the government  utility completed a long-term agreement l=easing the bruce facility, located on  the shores of lake huron, to a unit =of british energy earlier this year. wano,  in seeking to keep the records =secret, asserted nuclear safety is enhanced if  the public is kept in the d=ark about its findings because nuclear staff are more  likely to be honest =about mistakes if their remarks are kept confidential. but  ontario s infor=mation and privacy commissioner ruled last year there was a  "compelling in=terest" for the public to have the nuclear-safety information.  shortly aft=er the newspaper made its request for the records, the ontario  government =changed its information law to exempt provincially owned electricity  compa=nies from the act, blocking future public access to these safety reports.  =the wano reports, known as peer reviews, were viewed at the highest level o=f the  utility, with copies sent to ronald osborne, ontario power s preside=nt. during  wano reviews, a team of nuclear experts scours the plant, looki=ng for sloppy  work practices, poor maintenance and inadequate training, wh=ile also trying to  discover the causes of these failings. at the bruce pla=nt, wano officials  reviewed four of the eight reactors. the officials foun=d the failure to keep  accurate designs at the station, known as bruce b, h=elped create confusion over  three unplanned reactor shutdowns in 1997 that= were caused by the triggering of  automatic safety systems. operators had =a hard time figuring out why the  shutdowns happened because the designs sh=owed wiring layouts from the wrong  nuclear stations. the report also noted= that 10 forced reactor shutdowns were  caused by equipment problems. these= have arisen because the station had a "large  and increasing backlog" in p=reventive and corrective maintenance tasks.   staff also conducted incompet=ent maintenance work. in one case, a pump needing  an overhaul was taken fr=om service, but it was later discovered that the spare  parts for this work= were unavailable. "the pump was subsequently returned to  service without =undergoing the associated maintenance," the report said. i1998, there were =about 4,000 corrective maintenance tasks at the station. mr.  hawthorne sai=d that total is now less than 200, reflecting the plant s improving  perfor=mance. however, there was a backlog of about 1,000 preventive maintenance  =tasks in 1998, a figure that has since grown to 1,200. mr. hawthorne said t=he  total of preventive jobs is considered normal within the industry.=20barton adds supports for ferc authority and  rtossenate energy and air quality subcommittee chairman joe  barton (r-tx) has =revised his draft electricity bill to support the federal  energy regulator=y commission s (ferc) proposed requirement that forces utilities  to partic=ipate in regional transmission organizations (rtos). the proposal  requires= that all transmitting utilities form or participate in an rto within  18 m=onths. barton s draft bill also gives additional authority to ferc by  allo=wing the commission to propose changes to applications if minimum standards=  are not met. utilities would have the right to appeal ferc s decision to =the  federal courts. while ferc is pushing for the creation of four rtos, b=arton s  draft bill does not recommend a specific number of rtos. the revis=ed legislation  requires a 40,000 mw generation minimum from any new rto. t=his requirement was  added to minimize the amount of inter-rto transmission= problems. the bill  includes an incentive rate provision which opponents c=laim would undermine  ferc s authority to determine just and reasonable rat=es. proponents argue that  incentive rates are necessary to account for the= inherent risks that  transmission companies face.=20ferc s public access rulemaking is  questioneda federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) proposed rulemaking on public=  access of informational filings is generating mixed reactions. ferc is pr=oposing  that utilities and power marketers electronically file an "index o=f customers"  on a quarterly basis with a summary of the contractual terms =and conditions for  market-based power sales, cost-based power sales, and t=ransmission services. the  proposed rule would require that the information= be posted on a publicly  available internet website. state regulators see =ferc s july rulemaking proposal  as an opportunity to improve regulatory ov=ersight of competitive markets. the  national association of regulatory uti=lity commissioners (naruc) applauds the  proposal, stating, "one of the mos=t important and formidable tools in market  monitoring is access to data th=at is readily available and useful to the  public." however, utilities are =warning ferc that making such "proprietary and  commercially sensitive info=rmation" available to the public "could be harmful to  the development of r=obust electricity markets." the edison electric institute s  alliance of en=ergy suppliers is requesting that ferc defer action on the  rulemaking.debate over use of pjm as model for northeast  rtowholesale suppliers and the pjm interconnection have recommended that pjm s=  market design and governance structure be used as a model for a northeast=  regional transmission organization (rto). they believe that using the pjm= model  would facilitate the quickest transition from the current system of= independent  system operators (isos) to one large rto. duke energy north a=merica reported to  platts electric power daily that "the pjm market-buildi=ng philosophy of  cautious, incremental, modular building blocks which emph=asizes market-driven  solutions rather than command-and-control decision an=d frequent market  interventions has worked far better than approaches take=n in either new york or  new england." administrative law judge peter young= recommended on september 17,  2001 to the federal energy regulatory commis=sion (ferc) that pjm be used as a  starting point. young proposed an rto pl=an that would have an operational rto  within 36 months of the ferc order. =his recommendations resulted from the july  2001 mediation talks that discu=ssed the creation of a northeast rto. ferc has  since asked for comments re=garding young s plan. enron and pjm contend that an  rto could be operation=al within one year if ferc acts expeditiously. new york  iso and new englan=d iso argue that ferc should consider another approach because  using pjm a=s a model would ignore geographic and philosophic differences. the  pjm uti=lities do not have divested generating assets, as do the two regions not  c=overed by pjm. the isos also pointed out that pjm does not contain so-calle=d  load centers like new york city or boston.support for delay in arkansas  deregulationentergy, arkansas  largest electric utility, has agreed with state attorney=  general mark pryor to support a delay in the state s restructuring effort=s. an  amended restructuring statute in effect as of april 2001 pushed back= the start  date of deregulation to october, 2003. the public service commi=ssion (psc) was  given the authority to delay deregulation further until 20=05 if necessary to  ensure that deregulation will benefit consumers. severa=l concerns still exist,  according to local sources. a study by la capra as=sociates showed that arkansas  consumers might experience higher, more vola=tile electric rates if the retail  market is deregulated before october 200=5. the study also reports that wholesale  electric markets and operating el=ectronic systems haven t developed, both are  necessary for successful reta=il market competition. entergy s president, hugh  mcdonald, has also expres=sed concern that the federal energy regulatory  commission s (ferc) push to= create four regional transmission organizations  (rtos) may slow the move =to retail competition. additionally, state attorney  general pryor has note=d that two utilities serving the arkansas market are  experiencing difficul=ty meeting the january 2002 deregulation deadline in texas.  the governor, =psc, and the arkansas electric cooperative corporation consider  repeal of =deregulation to be the best choice for consumers. entergy believes  repeal =is unnecessary and that delaying until 2005 will cause no harm to  consumer=s. a psc hearing on the topic is set for october 18, 2001.entergy seeks deregulation delay in texastexas  is experiencing a less than seamless transition to a competitive ret=ail electric  market. entergy corp. has asked the public utility commission= of texas (puc) to  delay deregulation in the southeast texas service area =for 8 ? months,  transmission congestion is costing some texas utilities mi=llions of dollars, and  reports show that texas consumers have been subject= to "slamming" (switching  utility providers without their consent.) enterg=y s request is a turnaround from  the corporation s announcement in septemb=er that deregulation should move  forward and that it was ready to move int=o a competitive marketplace. the  corporation has now filed a memorandum al=ong with the puc staff, an industrial  electricity users group, and the off=ice of the public utility council, asking  the puc to delay deregulation fo=r 8 ? months. entergy s spokesperson says that  the request stems from the =federal energy regulatory commission s and entergy s  inability to come to =consensus on an independent regional transmission operator. =20problems for texas on the path to  deregulationmunicipally-owned austin energy is among a group of  texas utilities that h=ave experienced rising costs in a deregulated energy  market. their agreeme=nt to share transmission costs across the state for  generated electricity =is costing more than anticipated. the puc and the electric  reliability cou=ncil of texas (ercot) estimated last year that a state program  designed to= ensure that enough electricity can move around the state during peak  peri=ods would cost utilities $20 million in the year starting july 31, 2001.  s=ince each utility s share of the cost is based on its use of the grid, aust=in  energy expected its 4 percent share to be $800,000 for the first year. =however,  austin energy has already been billed approximately $2 million fo=r the  period between july 31 and september 21.north carolina  regulators oppose southeastern rto =20the north carolina utilities commission (ncuc) has expressed opposition to = the federal energy regulatory commission s (ferc) move to create four regi=onal  transmission organizations (rtos). in september, an administrative la=w judge  reported on closed-door mediation discussions aimed at developing =an rto in the  southeast. ncuc considers the 45-day long talks illegal. fer=c supports the  creation of a southeast rto, reflecting rto proposals submi=tted by gridsouth,  gridflorida, and entergy. ncuc objects that "...ferc is= now attempting to strip  retail customers of all rights to existing transm=ission capacity and make it  available...to relatively new entities, such a=s independent power producers and  marketers. this attempt must fail." ncuc= says that it will take its case to  court to prevent ferc from moving forw=ard on this issue."slamming" reported in texas pilot  programproblems arising from texas  move towards a competitive  retail electric ma=rket have also spread to the consumers. under the state s  pilot project, 5= percent of the market was opened to competition, allowing  companies to co=mpete for consumers by offering lower prices and different  service plans. =the texas deregulation law strictly prohibits "slamming,"  electric provide=rs switching consumer s service without obtaining permission.  new power co=mpany received at least 14 complaints about slamming; green  mountain, reli=ant, first choice and shell each received one "slamming"  complaint. the fo=rt worth star-telegram reported that 68 complaints have been  filed between= march 1, 2001 and september 27, 2001 concerning billing  procedures, delay=s in the pilot project, customer service and deceptive trade  practices. on= one positive note for consumers, the puc has published a consumer  educati=on brochure, "the electricity facts label: what it is and how it will  help= you shop for electricity." the brochure will help consumers understand the=  new electricity labels that retail electric providers (reps) are required= to  provide when retail competition begins. the label gives information on=  electricity prices, contract terms, generation sources, and emissions in =a  standardized format. the labels are intended to help customers make info=rmed  decisions about choosing their electric service.texas  power  supply to increasetwo new developments in texas are expected to  increase power supply in the= state. american electric power co. (aep) is  currently seeking approval fr=om the public utility commission of texas (puc) to  provide energy supply s=ervices to large commercial and industrial customers if  deregulation begin=s in january 2002. aep has a total of about 1 million  customers in texas w=ith its three subsidiaries: central power and light co.,  west texas utilit=ies and southwestern electric power co. the company expects the  puc to act= within two to three months. in addition, steag power, the  houston-based u=nit of germany-based electricity utility steag ag, plans to  develop a 900 =mw to 1,200 mw gas-fired power station in ennis, texas. the  company submit=ted its application to the electric reliabilty council of texas  and the so=uthwest power pool. construction is planned to begin next year and  reach c=ommercial operation by 2004. the plant will increase texas  generating  cap=acity and may help to relieve the state s congestion problem of transmittin=g  power from south to north. new power plants, as well as new transmission= lines,  are needed in the north to ease congestion.bingaman to resume  work on comprehensive energy billsenate energy and natural  resources committee chairman jeff bingaman (d-ne=w mexico) will resume  consideration of a comprehensive energy bill the wee=k of october 14. the bill  includes provisions related to electricity restr=ucturing, including expansion of  the federal energy regulatory commission =s (ferc) authority over municipal and  cooperative utilities. the proposed =legislation would also allow regional  transmission organizations to rely o=n ferc to rule when transmission projects  are delayed or rejected by state= officials.federal trade commission issues report on electric power  regulatory reforma new report has been issued by the federal  trade commission (ftc) that ex=amines state retail electricity programs and their  ability to provide cons=umer benefits. competition and consumer protection  perspectives on electri=c power regulatory reform: focus on retail competition  compares state and =federal authority on competitive issues and implementation of  successful r=etail competition programs. the ftc report finds that most electric  market=s are in a transitional phase. the benefits of a competitive market will  n=ot be realized until the advent of full competition, without price regulati=on,  has been achieved. the report also explains that competitive wholesale= markets  must accompany competition in retail markets. the report notes, "=... as  wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies an=d  jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale= and  retail competition to be successful." the ftc report also cites that = artificially low "standard-offer rates," which are provided to customers w=ho do  not choose a new supplier, may act as a barrier for new retail suppl=iers. these  low rates reduce the incentive for customers to seek

rulesthe supreme court heard arguments on wednesday on federal  energy regulator=y commission (ferc) jurisdiction to regulate wholesale  transmission servic=es and power sales. the court s ruling will have an important  impact on th=e u.s. power market. it could either open the transmission grid to  retail =competition or limit competition to the retail level. as dow jones  reports=, "the case has great ramifications for congressional debate on electric  i=ndustry restructuring legislation and ferc s ongoing efforts to promote  co=mpetition as a surrogate for regulation." nine states, led by new york, arg=ued  that ferc overstepped its authority with order 888, that required util=ities to  open their transmission lines to competing power merchants. lawre=nce malone,  general counsel for the group, argued that the order preempted= state authority  to regulate retail sales and set rates. in 1999, ferc car=ried the order further  by mandating that utilities turn over control of th=eir power lines to  independent regional transmission organizations, or rto=s. the states are  appealing the district of columbia court of appeals deci=sion in june 2000 that  upheld ferc s orders. currently, ferc is working to= establish four rtos to  control the nation s transmission system. meanwhil=e, enron, the largest u.s.  wholesale power player, argued that ferc violat=ed federal law because it did not  require access to transmission lines whe=n utilities kept transmission and retail  sales as one operation. this bund=led service remains in many states where  competition is not yet allowed. c=aught in the middle, ferc argued that its  orders were issued to achieve a =balance between giving competitors equal access  to power lines and leaving= retail market issues to the states.ferc chairman unveils planspat wood, the federal  energy regulatory commission s new chairman, has pro=posed a set of issues on  which he wants the commission to focus. at the co=mmission s september 26th  meeting, wood proposed the following for ferc s =upcoming agenda: ensuring  adequate generation capacity; transmission const=raints; regional transmission  organizations (rtos); energy infrastructure;= standards of conduct for  transmission providers; market monitoring and en=forcement; and market based  rates. one important proposal unveiled at this= meeting would mandate that  transmission owning utilities be given until d=ecember 15, 2001, to join an  approved rto or lose their right to charge ma=rket based rates. additionally,  wood recommended that mergers would only b=e approved for power entities  belonging to operational rtos. "once the ent=ire country is covered by rtos," he  said, "states will have the option to =deregulate on the retail level or not."  wood also proposed a rulemaking on= market design and structure in order to make  a seamless national power ma=rketplace. a new transmission tariff would replace  the pro forma open acce=ss transmission tariff established by order 888. staff at  ferc discussed c=hanging the commission s methodology for assessing market power  for the pu=rpose of approving market-based rate applications. while none of the  propo=sals were voted on, the meeting was important for opening up discussion and=  addressing the commission s key challenges and objectives for the coming =year. a  series of commissioner-led workshops will be held at ferc s headqu=arters from  october 15-19, 2001. congestion management, cost recovery, mar=ket monitoring,  transmission planning, business and reliability standards,= and the nature of  transmission rights have been proposed for discussion a=t the workshops.maryland and dc blast ferc on rto planboth the  maryland and washington dc public service commissions have expres=sed concern  over the federal energy regulatory commission s (ferc) initiat=ive to integrate  the u.s. northeast transmission network. in a new plan pr=oposed by ferc chairman  pat wood, utilities would have to submit plans by =december 15, 2001, to join a  regional transmission organization (rto) or l=ose the right to sell electricity  in the wholesale market. catherine reill=y, chairman of the maryland public  utility commission, is concerned about =the plan s effect on the northeast s  economy and the potential for creatin=g another california-type crisis. the  maryland commission held hearings on= rtos in baltimore on wednesday and thursday  of this week.southwest and midwest utilities form transmission  groupsferc s push for utilities to merge their networks into  regional transmissi=on organizations (rtos) came one step closer to being  realized this week. =six southwestern utilities have signed an initial  "memorandum of understan=ding" regarding the formation and operation of an rto  and plan to file wit=h ferc by mid-october. the new rto, westconnect, will be  created by arizon=a public service co., salt river project, el paso electric co.,  public ser=vice company of new mexico, tucson electric power co., and texas-new  mexic=o power co. in addition, six midwestern utilities filed with ferc last  fri=day to create an independent, for-profit transmission company, translink. t=he  utilities include alliant energy, corn belt power cooperative, midameri=can  energy, nebraska public power district, xcel energy, and omaha public =power  district. "a for-profit entity, focused solely on the growth and enh=ancement of  a robust transmission system over a large region, will be much= more effective  than either the current situation or transferring operatio=nal control to an  independent system operator," said wayne brunetti, chair=man, president, and ceo  of xcel energy. the six companies have asked ferc =to expedite their application  so that translink can be formed by early nex=t year.north carolina s restructuring plans still on  holdthe north carolina study commission on the future of  electric service has =decided to place its restructuring deliberations on hold  until early next =year. study commission meetings were interrupted early in 2001  due to the =length of the state legislative session, which occupied several study  comm=ission members. members of the commission have expressed concern about  imp=lementing electricity restructuring. sen. kay hagan, d-guilford, explained = that, "i can t see us doing anything...there are so many people worried  a=bout...california." hagan and rep. mary jarrell, d-guilford, also on the  c=ommission, have urged north carolina to take the steps necessary to avoid t=he  same problems experienced in california. neither legislator foresees th=e study  commission resuming its deliberations until january 2002.pennsylvania retail electricity shopping  declinesaccording to figures released last tuesday by the  pennsylvania office of c=onsumer advocate, electricity retail shopping fell  during the third quarte=r of 2001. the number of consumers buying from  alternative suppliers dropp=ed 8% from july 1st. this decline is less than the  32% drop that occurred =between april and july; total electric load has declined  by 10% since july=. 337,918 or 6.4% of the customers in the state are buying  1,458 mw from o=ther suppliers, or approximately 6% of the state s total load.  again, this= is less than the 67% decline in electric load purchased from other  suppli=ers that occurred between april and july. according to the electric power  =daily online, "load fell more dramatically than customer participation in t=he  spring because many of the expiring long-term contracts were held by la=rge  industrial and commercial customers." pennsylvania opened its electric=ity market  to competition in 1999. in april of 2000, 10% of the state resi=dents chose  alternative energy suppliers, subsequently, high gas prices an=d tight electric  capacity drove up wholesale prices in the summer of 2000.= many alternative  suppliers pulled out of the market, as they were unable =to offer competitive  prices. participation in the retail electricity marke=t has been declining since  then.texas  electricity-grid operator needs more power  linesan annual report released on monday by the electric  reliability council of= texas states that texas needs more electricity  transmission lines, raisin=g concern as the state plans to open its electricity  market to competition= in january 2002. without adequate transmission lines,  congestion problems= will likely arise and the flow of power may be interrupted.  the report ha=s identified six zones where more lines are needed to deliver power  from s=outh to north texas and to bring electricity into the dallas area. eight  m=ajor projects are being developed to address the problems and others are be=ing  considered.copyright ? 2001 egnatia research &  management. all rights reserved15997.53 433 50615.52 341.85 14764.35 473.13 35917.85 473.13 46019.6 463.86 48317.32 473.13 12849.83

<67753, [ -----original message-----from: 	"russo, brian" <brian.russo@ubsw.com>@enron   on behalf of "abramson, barry" <barry.abramson@ubsw.com>sent:	monday, november 26, 2001 7:37 amto:	undisclosed-recipients:;@enronsubject:	electric utilities:  weekly updatekey points*	on the basis of the group s extremely low relative valuation, we continue to recommend the electric utilitygroup.  the electric group s p/e based upon 2002 estimated eps is now only 10.8x, compared with a 2002 p/e for the s&p500 of 24.5x.  the relative p/e ratio has dropped to just 0.44x, near its all-time low of 0.40x and well below the25-year historic normal relative p/e range of 0.60x to 0.80x.*	the high relative yield of 5.0% on the average electric utility stock also should provide good support againstany major downward move, in our opinion.  the relative yield on utility stocks is more than double the yields availableto small investors in cash equivalents such as money market funds.*	the fully-regulated transmission and distribution utilities (t&d) appear to have stopped outperforming theutilities that have a large merchant energy exposure.  the lower-risk, higher-yielding t&d stocks had been going up formost of the past few months while the utilities with merchant energy had been falling.  now it appears that the rotationinto the t&d stocks has ended, at least for now.*	last week, we added ppl corp. (ppl-$35.80, rated strong buy)[2] to our global top 10 list of utility stocks.the major reasons for adding ppl to the global top 10 list were the stock s very low relative p/e ratio, its fleet oflow-cost unregulated generating plants and its above-average earnings growth potential.  we also believe it is likelythat ppl might take actions to improve its very low stock price, such as a dividend hike and a common share buyback.  inaddition, at ppl s current low relative valuation, we believe it is an attractive takeover target.  there are four otheru.s. utility stocks on our global top 10 list-dominion resources (d-$59.96, rated strong buy)[2], duke energy(duk-$37.64, rated strong buy)[2], txu corp. (txu-$45.87, rated strong buy)[2] and american electric power (aep-$42.39,rated buy)[2].  the rest of our global top 10 list includes el paso energy (epg-$49.73)[14] of the u.s., suez-lyonnaiseand lattice group of europe, and tokyo electric power and chubu electric of asia.*	the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) issued an order last week that changes the basis upon which fercwill allow large utilities to sell wholesale power at market-based rates.  ferc s order is designed to reduce thepossibility that a large company could exert market power in a particular region.  ferc stated that if power sellers arefound to be "pivotal to their region" and if the sellers are not participating in a ferc approved regional transmissionorganization (rto), then the sellers could lose their right to charge market-based rates.  sellers that are "pivotal totheir region" have generating units that must run to meet the region s electric load.  ferc applied these new rulesimmediately to three large utilities-american electric power, entergy corp. (etr-$36.95, rated hold) and southerncompany (so-$23.50, rated hold)[2].  ferc stated that all three of these large utilities are not now currently membersof a ferc approved rto.  aep, etr and so have lost the authority to make sales at market-based rates except for salesthat take place in regions where the grid is controlled by a ferc-approved rto.  the three companies have been given 15days to respond by ferc.  under the new rules, ferc can order refunds and can order these companies to revert back tocost-based rates.*	it is possible that ferc is using this directive to strongly influence the rapid formation of ferc-approvedrtos.  some of the larger u.s utilities have been reluctant to join large rtos and have tried to form their own rtos inwhich they would be the dominant member.  in the long run, we expect ferc to prevail and we expect all u.s. utilities,large and small, to form rtos that have ferc approval.  we think that the loss of the ability to sell wholesale power atmarket-based rates, even if only for a short period of time until the company achieves compliance with ferc s rto goals,is a strong enough incentive for large utilities to move faster to join large rtos.*	we lowered our eps estimates for edison international (eix-$14.20, rated buy)[2,10] after the company held aconference call last week at which time it gave new earnings guidance for 2001 and 2002.  we lowered our 2001 epsestimate from $1.75 to $1.30 and reduced our 2002 eps estimate from $2.00 to $1.60.  it appears that eix s majoremphasis over the next 1 to 2 years will be to improve its balance sheet and regain its financial health, and therefore,earnings growth does not appear to be a major objective.*	we reduced our 2002 eps estimate on cinergy corp. (cin-$30.87, rated strong buy) from $2.95 to $2.85.  lowerforward power prices for 2002 and the weakness in the local economy are likely to hurt 2002 earnings.*	txu announced two major asset divestitures in the united kingdom last week.  txu plans to sell its u.k. electricdistribution business and its 50% interest in 24seven to london electricity for $1.87 billion.  txu also announced anagreement to sell its 2,000 mw west burton power station to london electricity for $523 million.  we think that both ofthese moves are positive steps for txu.  (additional details can be found in the following section of this report.)*	utility stocks lagged the overall market last week.  for the four trading days last week, electric utilitystocks were virtually unchanged, with an average gain of only 0.1%, compared with an increase of 1.0% for the s&p 500.ipp stocks had a bad week, with an average decline of 3.1%. <<wkly11126.doc>> - wkly11126.doc visit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.comthis message contains confidential information and is intended onlyfor the individual named.  if you are not the named addressee youshould not disseminate, distribute or copy this e-mail.  pleasenotify the sender immediately by e-mail if you have received thise-mail by mistake and delete this e-mail from your system.e-mail transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error-freeas information could be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed,arrive late or incomplete, or contain viruses.  the sender thereforedoes not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contentsof this message which arise as a result of e-mail transmission.  ifverification is required please request a hard-copy version.  thismessage is provided for informational purposes and should not beconstrued as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities orrelated financial instruments.32008.59 473.13 16339.17 473.13 23784.16 473.13 37572.4 520.8 55138.47 583.67 25428.56 473.13 47810.9 473.13 6203.11 495.56 22768.43 473.13 27071.52 473.13 34086.93 473.13 17770.95 518.56 74736 264.83 13938.04 473.13 51701.8 473.13 32546.42 473.13 32008.59 473.13 27071.52 473.13 26882.09 482.13 48431.36 473.13 28033.61 504.57 50153.56 454.24 74736 264.83 32567.68 473.13 62694.12 473.13 15997.53 433 32399.03 520.8 26882.09 482.13 45594.36 264.83 26091.54 473.13 25428.56 473.13 29779.97 485.41 20970.36 473.13 26882.09 482.13 64210.95 464.19 43700.13 472.93 794.42 473.13 15508.99 473.13 27071.52 473.13 61312.59 470.19 38363.44 511.9 32567.68 473.13 15430.23 377.22 51150.44 449.53 9942.77 473.13 39902.5 547.33 66013.85 473.13 32008.59 473.13 13680.48 473.13 38391.46 458.57 25428.56 473.13 3427.01 484.34 40555.33 374.69 25428.56 473.13 8677.69 473.13 68512.59 473.13 65149.85 421.28 31001.07 462.98 33386.26 473.13 2749.05 473.13 15297.83 466.75 74736 264.83 ]>

amto:	undisclosed-recipients:;@enronsubject:	electric utilities:  weekly reportkey points*	it is like being in the eye of a hurricane as we wait to have quarterly earnings reports come pouring in.  sofar only one company, nrg energy (nrg-$19.05, rated strong buy), a pure play ipp, has reported earnings, and the quarterwas slightly better than expected.  nrg also reaffirmed its full year 2001 and 2002 eps guidance.*	based upon the number of favorable preannouncements that greatly outnumbered the number of negativepreannouncements, we remain confident that the third quarter reports should be relatively strong for most electricutilities and ipps.*	we continue to recommend an overweighting in the electric stocks.  in an environment of economic slowdown andfalling interest rates, utility stocks should perform relatively well.*	in addition, utility stocks still appear undervalued based upon historic valuation measures.  utility stocks arenow trading at an average p/e ratio of 10.5x estimated 2002 eps compared with a 2002 p/e ratio of 22.7x for the s&p 500.the relative p/e ratio of 0.46x is well below the 25-year historic normal range of 0.60x-0.80x.*	american electric power (aep-$44.08, rated buy)[2] agreed to acquire two huge coal-fired power plants in theu.k. from edison international (eix-$15.34, rated buy)[2].  eix s subsidiary, edison mission energy, sold the fiddler sferry and ferrybridge power plants, each one 2,000 mw in size, for a big loss.  since the time when eix bought the twopower plants in 1999, power prices in the u.k. have fallen sharply and the country is now oversupplied with electricpower.  power prices are expected to remain low in the u.k. for quite a while.  aep agreed to pay $960 million for thepower plants and certain fuel supplies.  for aep, the purchase price for the power plants is about $200 per kilowatt.edison international paid about twice as much when it purchased the plants in 1999.  eix said that it intends to take anafter-tax write-off of about $1.18 billion to reflect the loss on the asset sale and related currency adjustments.*	niagara mohawk power (nmk-$17.75, rated buy)[2], national grid group, the staff of the new york public servicecommission and several other parties, announced a settlement that includes a rate plan for ten years following theproposed merger of nmk and national grid.  under the agreement, niagara mohawk would reduce rates for electricitydelivery by $160 million, or 8%, upon closing of the merger.  following this one-time rate cut, delivery charges wouldremain stable for the next ten years.  the settlement is based upon a 10.6% return on equity with an earnings sharingplan.  the plan allows nmk to retain 100% of earnings up to an 11.75% roe with sharing for earnings above an 11.75% roe.the plan also allows nmk to retain 50% of merger-related savings and the roe sharing plan does not include the retainedsavings.  the agreement also requires nmk to give up recovery of $850 million of nuclear-related stranded costs.  thepublic service commission is expected to vote on the settlement by late 2001.  we would expect the state regulators toapprove the settlement and to approve the merger at the same time.  the merger is expected to be completed in the firstquarter of 2002.*	now it appears that public service of new mexico (pnm-$26.71, rated hold) has decided to go to court toterminate its pending acquisition of western resources  utility business (wr-$17.12, rated hold)[2].  on friday, pnmissued a press release saying that pnm had asked a court in new york to resolve the disagreement between pnm and wrregarding the merger.  pnm is asking the court "to find that it is impossible to complete the proposed transaction underthe original terms."  pnm also wants the court to rule that the electric rate reduction imposed by regulators in kansasprovides sufficient cause to terminate the merger agreement.  the ceo of pnm also said that pnm believes that thecurrent agreement must be restructured if there is any chance of the merger going ahead.  however, wr has demanded thatthe original transaction be pursued even though certain rulings by state regulators in kansas appear to make this nearlyimpossible.  pnm and western had agreed previously that wr had to complete its corporate separation plan, separating itsutility operations from its nonutility businesses, before the merger could be completed.  however, the regulators inkansas refused to approve the terms of wr s corporate separation plan and they have ordered a halt to the implementationof the separation plan.  kansas regulators want changes to be made to the corporate separation plan in order to providea stronger balance sheet for the utility post separation.*	the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) approved the acquisition of powergen of the u.k. by germanutility e.on last week.  also last week, regulators in the state of virginia approved the acquisition.  previously, thestate of kentucky also approved the deal.  the approvals from ferc, virginia and kentucky were needed because powergenowns lg&e energy, the u.s. electric utility that serves most of kentucky and a portion of virginia.  the sec still needsto approve the merger, which is expected to be completed in the spring of 2002.  we expect e.on to use this deal as aspringboard toward making several other acquisitions of u.s. utilities.  right next door to lg&e energy is one of ourtop takeover candidates, cinergy corp. (cin-$31.90, rated strong buy).*	utility stocks lagged the overall market last week.  for the five trading days last week, electric utilitystocks went down in value by 3.9% compared with a gain of 1.9% for the s&p 500.  ipp stocks had a strong week, with anaverage stock appreciation of 8.2% <<wkly11015.doc>> - wkly11015.doc visit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.comthis message contains confidential information and is intended onlyfor the individual named.  if you are not the named addressee youshould not disseminate, distribute or copy this e-mail.  pleasenotify the sender immediately by e-mail if you have received thise-mail by mistake and delete this e-mail from your system.e-mail transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error-freeas information could be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed,arrive late or incomplete, or contain viruses.  the sender thereforedoes not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contentsof this message which arise as a result of e-mail transmission.  ifverification is required please request a hard-copy version.  thismessage is provided for informational purposes and should not beconstrued as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities orrelated financial instruments.27071.52 473.13 68270.98 473.13 33781.53 473.13 22659.7 473.13 15997.53 433 6654.93 473.13 32399.03 520.8 22768.43 473.13 7832.54 473.13 46443.87 473.13 9025.61 473.13 22768.43 473.13 63416.54 426.87 12242.9 473.13 20138.74 473.13 74736 264.83 38174.5 446.63 74736 264.83 9942.77 473.13 25428.56 473.13 4410.36 473.13 66412.51 473.13 33781.53 473.13 27071.52 473.13 26882.09 482.13 43840.75 537.53 37778.26 488.72 15595.97 473.13 26882.09 482.13 2691.54 439.51 19219.65 473.13 53352 452.19 53777.72 473.13 36225.66 473.13 459.54 473.13 11357.64 520.8 66446.82 473.13 1418.74 428.38 11357.64 520.8 459.54 473.13 21449.23 467.54 45834.52 453.33 45251.76 460.49 21449.23 467.54 27071.52 473.13 49426.79 473.13 12943.09 473.13 49177.93 473.13 41621.8 456.29 35472.81 473.13 43840.75 537.53 63892.03 473.13 66053.96 473.13 50119.25 473.13 74222.82 473.13 50119.25 473.13 50119.25 473.13 5275.81 474.96 6114.2 439.84 6114.2 439.84 21452.13 473.13 59981.8 473.13 32567.68 473.13 50996.78 473.13 35472.81 473.13 38391.46 458.57 33781.53 473.13 33874.31 473.13 22768.43 473.13 18735.95 471.63 41069.96 488.91 10993.29 472.96 40983.95 473.13 44960.86 435.39 65922.52 431.09 35787.87 473.13 74736 264.83 2749.05 473.13 ]>

(ppl-$37.00,rated strong buy)[2], duke energy (duk-$37.17, rated strong buy)[2] and nrg energy (nrg-$15.50, rated strong buy).we also favor a few of the seemingly over-sold diversified energy/convergence stocks, such as dominion resources(d-$58.98, rated strong buy)[2] and nisource (ni-$23.40, rated strong buy). <<wkly10924.doc>>  <<wkly10924.pdf>> - wkly10924.doc  - wkly10924.pdf visit our website at http://www.ubswarburg.comthis message contains confidential information and is intended onlyfor the individual named.  if you are not the named addressee youshould not disseminate, distribute or copy this e-mail.  pleasenotify the sender immediately by e-mail if you have received thise-mail by mistake and delete this e-mail from your system.e-mail transmission cannot be guaranteed to be secure or error-freeas information could be intercepted, corrupted, lost, destroyed,arrive late or incomplete, or contain viruses.  the sender thereforedoes not accept liability for any errors or omissions in the contentsof this message which arise as a result of e-mail transmission.  ifverification is required please request a hard-copy version.  thismessage is provided for informational purposes and should not beconstrued as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities orrelated financial instruments.13923.06 473.13 34871.19 473.13 2768.86 463.04 22447.09 473.13 7369.61 473.13 51396.89 319.01 14360.38 473.13 56438.34 473.13 47810.9 473.13 56438.34 473.13 15410.9 473.13 72115.97 379.2 8440.43 473.13 32567.68 473.13 27071.52 473.13 32567.68 473.13 25428.56 473.13 20369.72 464.19 22768.43 473.13 34086.93 473.13 51172.67 454.54 49704.16 462.98 2749.05 473.13 21905.88 724.7 66899.6 473.13 49704.16 462.98 26882.09 482.13 33781.53 473.13 ]>

coeclerici vessel from colombia to rotterdam to cover our short to preag in november.  still have a late november short against cargill from richards bay to rotterdam to cover within the next couple weeks.on the abc front, met with elcano ( largest spanish shipping company ) to discuss a possible partnership to acquire abc but quickly realised that they do not have the stomach for such a big deal.  however, did discover that they are quite active on the lng side and are about to close on a lng vessel purchase within the next couple weeks.  we are definitely going to stay in contact to potentially develop some alliances on the lng side.late in the week heard that bocimar had met with abc not to purchase them but to discuss a pooling agreement.  from good sources were told that abc had no interest in bocimar s offer and therefore we are planning on meeting abc to continue to express our interest in acquiring their fleet and more importantly to continue to frustrate bocimars attempt to control the cape fleet.     we have completed our  enron shipping  powerpoint presentation for eol and we expect to have a shipping section within the eol platform by mid next month in time for coaltrans.  this new platform will allow our customers to log into eol and go directly to our shipping web page to be able to trade with us.  currently, customers have to access the international coal web page to access our shipping products which does not make sense to our customersalso pierre met in paris with usinor ( 3rd largest steel mill in the world ) to discuss some potential freight

shipping services weekly report 39/2000highlighthad a meeting with bocimar in our offices this week as they were interested in knowing our plans with abc.  from meeting it became very clear that they were out of the running for abc as they were unwilling to purchase that company without a significant discount to current market levels.  few days later, met with ceo of abc as he had just received a bid from a rival shipping company ( zodiac ) and he was basically begging us to join the bidding as he really did not want his company  to fall in the hands of zodiac.  pierre and i continued to express our interest in abc but told him that we needed more time to evaluate their assets and could not counter on such short notice.  told abc that we would continue to follow with interest and that if buy out by zodiac failed, we would come back to discuss.  our goal all along was to make sure that bocimar were not going to get their hands on abc or they would have effectively controlled 50 % of the spot cape fleet and made our short position into next year look worrisome.  having shown interest we not only were kept well advised as to what bocimar was up to but it could have reacted quickly to protect our position.  we are relatively pleased with the potential of zodiac buying abc. also, this week we fixed another coeclerici cape for period.  we fixed the cape asia build in 1990 for minimum 4-6 months to allow us to use the vessel to load out of australia for clp in december and hedge ourselves against a late winter surge in cape rates but we have the added advantage of having an option for a further two years to be declared mid january 2001.  we bought ourselves a very cheap call option with an exercise date in three months time in a very volatile market.  further, coeclerici gave us a put in year two to cap our downside and gave us a call option to extend the deal into an additional third year .  we are currently discussing with bocimar the idea of putting that cape into their pool if they secure us a floor for year one and a share in any upside.  will keep you posted  !!!fixed a 6 panamax contract as vessel owner with national power from south africa to bristol with option immingham to give us a very useful short position into next year in the panamax sector.  this deal will add to our already significant business in south africa for next year and will allow us to arbitrage between cape and panamax vessels as we hold contracts in both sectors.  furthermore, intercore has asked us to offer them 6 capes from bolivar into ara from next march till september which if we were to win the contract would make us a definite market maker in the two busiest coal routes ( rbct/ara and colombia/ara ).  market	short term	medium term	long termhandy

james/eu/enron@enron, cornelia luptowitsch/lon/ect@ect subject: freight weekly reportenron shipping services weekly report 43/2000highlightthe cape market continues to rise almost daily with rbct to rotterdam at $11.40 and quennsland to rotterdam at $15.5 in the spot market.  the driving factor has not been coal as of late, but an unexpected rush of iron ore cargoes.  on the panamax front, rates have been easing for the last few weeks, as the expected strong grain activity in the us gulf as not yet materialised.  the average time charter rate on capes is now in excess of $25,000 daily and close to $11,000 on panamaxes.  the general view in the market is that prices for both capes and panamaxes will remain strong though to april/may 2001 by which time steel mills will have reduced raw material imports and adversely affected cape rates and the shear number of newbuildings on the panamax front will drag earnings down as well.  our group tends to believe that the balance of the year will see yet firmer rates but we expect a slow down and a decrease in rates to take effect towards the first two months of next year as we already are seeing some owners desperately seeking to cover themselves for next year at very aggressive numbers ( hadeed contract ) and we are getting the feeling that bocimar is keenly interested to cover their long position even tough their length is mainly through march/april next year.  furthernore, the asian owners seem more and more agressive with rates for next year as their countries are hitting some rough patches currently, as evidenced by their stock markets and strong comments against continued strong crude oil prices.on the abc front, it appears as if zodiac and p&o have agreed in principal to a deal by which zodiac buys 50% of abc but gets full control of the company.  details are still patchy and we are keeping a close eye on the possibility of zodiac putting their newly acquired vessels into the bocimar pool as that would have a drastic bullish effect on rates for some months to come.  we have proposed to bocimar a 5 year collar deal by which we get access to 5 million tons of freight each year with ability to settle the collar deal against an index and have the ability to call upon physical tonnage each year.  furthermore, we would have ability to have a washout clause for each year by which we would pay a fix lump sum cash amount.   we have also built in several other options and we are waiting for an answer from bocimar sometime next week.  this deal would offer us access to modern vessels at a price similar to that of the cape index of the last 10 years and with enough built in options to take advantage of any sudden market changes.on the logistics front, coeclerici is coming in next week to make a presentation on their port handling operations in india/ indonesia and venezuela with the idea of teaming up with us on forthcoming tenders where we would offer the long term coal contracts into or out of certain ports, as the case maybe, and they would build and manage the port operations.  they currently have some interesting contracts in indonesian ports which should have special interest to us vis a vis clp.  our two cape deals with coeclerici are still not finalised as we are still having a few issues with credit language but expect the deals to close within the next 10 days.on the eol front, andy james has been able to get edftrading to trade 225,000 tons of freight via eol this week and he has added louis dreyfus grain and billiton and rwe trading to the list of customers that have trading authority on our system.regarding the lighter side of business, enron dry bulk shipping was featured in tradewinds, a weekly shipping  newspaper, with 3 pages dedicated to our rapid

cape market continues to slide ever southward with owners unable to repeat last done on rates obtained.  richards bay to rotterdam rates have fallen about $2 in 45 days ( key coal route )  and brazil to china rates have fallen $3 in the same period ( key iron ore route ) which has owners running for cargo  coverage.  however charterers smell blood and are not willing to enter into freight contracts ( edf trading and ncsc  are playing spot and so are we ).  even the mighty bocimar seems unable to turn the tide and are offering us cheap rates on the quiet as they keep playing their vessels spot and are  being run over.  the average cape rate has lost $ 4200 from its peak and hangs around $20,400 presently.  to get cargo contracts for the balance of the year an owner has to fix his vessel at around $16,000 to get charterers willing to agree.  the downward fall is the result of two concurrent market shifts 1- coal shipments into europe have slowed 2- market is predicting that sometime in q1 2001 , japanese steel mills will cut back on production and reduce their raw material imports.  as a result, you have on one side, japanese vessel owners panicking as they fear that their main account ( japan ) will not need their vessels shortly and you have the european owners also worried as they are seeing their utilities postponing their coal requirements.  furthermore, the holiday season in asia is approaching and little activity is predicted for the next few weeks.on the panamax front, the outlook is still very bleak as you now have about two new buildings being launched per week in a market which is currently well balanced.  in the spot market, the atlantic is weak as the grain out of the us gulf is slow as the main rivers are frozen upstream and the vessels have little to load.  in the east the market is strong as there is a flurry of grain activity but in the paper market, february is already traded at a big discount to jan as people predict a quick slowdown in the activity as asia goes on holiday.on the long term strucutred front, last week we agreed to charter a new cape building starting in late 2003 for 10 years with an option for an 11th, 12 th, 13 th and 14 th year.  furthermore, we have the option to buy the vessel after year 3 at a fixed agreed japanese yen amount ( if currency goes our way, we buy the vessel dirt cheap !!!).  the counterparty in mitsui, a big and financially strong japanese company.  the deal is still subject a few details but we hope to be able to book this deal within the next 5 months when the ship building contract will be drawn up.also last week we had about 6 banks over a period of three days come to our office to discuss possible opportunities in the shipping world and to get them to trade on eol.  larry lawyer and simon crowe organized the meetings and we expect a few of these leads to pay off sometime this year.market	short term	medium term	long termhandy

<95226, [looks good.  certainly an area we need more focus on.  obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.  as an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages.  it would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way.  the fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless.  the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful.  if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way.  what s switching vis a vis last year.   whats production relative to last year.  it simplifies the fundamental analysis.from: jennifer fraser/enron@enronxgate on 03/12/2001 05:46 pmto: john arnold/hou/ect@ectcc:  subject: fw: lng weekly updatean initial effort--please comment61437.26 473.13 23672.05 473.13 32399.03 520.8 55249.61 459.95 41502.44 473.13 68512.59 473.13 25428.56 473.13 37286.82 473.13 32008.59 473.13 72694.39 473.13 31785.34 473.13 7814.66 473.13 ]>

small business sbsc president darrell mckigney testified before the house small business committee on october 10.  mckigney explained the important role that small business plays in the economy, and laid out a pro-small business policy agenda that featured speeding up and making permanent the tax cuts passed earlier this year; cutting or eliminating the capital gains tax; granting the president trade promotion authority; and enacting an energy plan that frees up domestic energy producers. to read the full testimony, go to: <http://www.sbsc.org/congressionaltestimony.asp?formmode=congressionaltestimony&id=40> 2.  sbsc addresses media on small business and economic issues on october 11, sbsc chairman karen kerrigan, president darrell mckigney, and chief economist raymond j. keating discussed the state of small business and the economy in a tele-conference call with reporters from newsweek, business week, newsday, human events, cnsnews.com, baltimore sun, arizona republic and the orange county register.  2.   free trade for small business, trade promotion authority for the president sbsc chief economist raymond j. keating wrote a new report--"international trade: the business of small business"-that explains the importance of free and open trade for our economy and for the small business community.  keating lays out a pro-free trade agenda, featuring passage of trade promotion authority for the president. sbsc s report "international trade: the business of small business" can be downloaded from the front page at <http://www.sbsc.org/> under the "21st century small business policy series." 3.   sbsc and other groups urge congress to grant tpa to president bush sbsc chairman karen kerrigan signed an october 9 letter to congress urging passage of trade promotion authority (tpa) for the president.  in part, the letter said: "world trade is increasingly important to small business.  nearly one-third of all u.s. merchandise export sales -- the stuff whose labels read, "made in america"-- are produced by companies with less than 500 people on their payrolls.  two-thirds of the firms participating in the export economy actually have less than 20 employees. what s more, the overall value of small-business exports has increased by 300 percent since the mid-1990s, according to the u.s. small business administration.  between 1987 and 1997, the number of u.s. small business exporters tripled from 65,900 to 202,185, according to the u.s. department of commerce.  that number will grow substantially if president bush were given trade promotion authority." to read the full letter to congress, go to: <http://www.sbsc.org/letterstocongress.asp?formmode=letterstocongress&id=113> 5. sbsc chairman maps out road to recovery in a recent article written for the washington times, sbsc chairman karen kerrigan spelled out the policies needed to put the economy and the entrepreneurial sector of the u.s. economy back on a path of growth. to read the full washington times op-ed by kerrigan, go to: <http://www.sbsc.org/latestnews_action.asp?formmode=smallbusbriefs&id=113> 6. capital gains tax cut-good for the economy, good for the stock market in his latest sbsc cybercolumn, sbsc chief economist raymond j. keating explains why cutting the capital gains tax is good for both the economy and the stock market, and provides the historical evidence to back up his claims. to read the sbsc cybercolumn, go to: <http://www.sbsc.org/latestnews_action.asp?formmode=cybercolumn&id=178> 7.  msas and the uninsured in the sbsc fact of the week, the latest numbers show that tax-free medical savings accounts help to reduce the number of uninsured individuals. <http://www.sbsc.org/factofweek.asp?formmode=call&linktype=text&id=162> 8. sbsc organizes allies to oppose "one-watt" mandates in senate energy legislation  in an october 5 letter to congress, sbsc chairman karen kerrigan and representatives from other groups wrote: "while it is still uncertain whether the senate will consider comprehensive energy legislation, we are writing to alert you to our concern about a specific provision that could undermine the current work of the congress to bring stability and growth to our nation s economy.  as this important legislation is being debated, we urge you to proceed with caution in imposing new burdens on businesses and consumers through mandates and regulations.  specifically, we are asking that you reject the onerous "one-watt" provisions similar to those slipped into the house energy bill, h.r. 4.  if enacted, these one-watt restrictions will cost consumers money and convenience, place undue burdens on businesses, while creating a new layer of government bureaucracy." to read the rest of this letter, go to: <http://www.sbsc.org/letterstocongress.asp?formmode=letterstocongress&id=112>   9.  old-time baseball in their latest "carolan &

legislative weekly report week ending 1/12recent events:-- iep has been meeting with legislators over the past two weeks.  janand//or katie and i have been attending these meetings.  since jan has beenin washington dc we have rescheduled some of the more important meetings forwhen he is back in town next week.  in general the meetings fall into twocategories and seem to be defined by party affiliation.  while this may notbe everyone s experience, our experience so far has showed that many of therepublicans have embraced our message and are offering to lend support wherethey are able.  many of the democrats have demonstrated extreme caution, areinterested in our message, but offering little or no support.  the majortheme for them is what they can take back to their districts.the one exception on the democratic side so far has been senator machado whohas requested iep draft language on long-term contracting.  senator billmorrow (r) has requested assistance in drafting language on the nimby sitingissue, which we agreed to do so.  we have agree to assist both.from hereon, we will focus on our meeting efforts on the new assembly ecacommittee members and "meet and greets" with the new members in both theassembly and the senate.  because this meeting list was changing on anhourly basis, it was impossible to forward to board members.  please besure, if you haven t already, to send us a list of your representatives sowe can contact you when a meeting with them has been confirmed.-- assembly u&c staff organized a meeting with the cec and generators withrepower projects.  generators in attendance included representatives fromduke, dynegy, southern, aes and sunrise (williams was there but didn tspeak).  after each of the participants airing their grievances, we weretasked with developing language, getting the generating industry to supportit and supporting it in the legislative process.  we were given until fridayto hand in bill language to the u&c staff.  such a commitment comes withmany promises and pitfalls which shuld be discussed next week on aconference call which iep will be setting up.-- as reported in an e-mail yesterday, the first two special session billspassed out of the new assembly energy costs and availability (eca) committeeyesterday (abx 5 and abx6, both attached, but amended versions not in printyet).  both measures also passed off the assembly floor today and are ontheir way to the senate for consideration in the senate energy committee.members of that committee have not yet been announced.-- the governor had a press conference today to announce a plan to reducecalifornia s energy use by at least five percent within a week.  during theq&a portion of the press conference the governor suggested the three membersof the new iso board should be the president of the cpuc, and the chairs ofthe eob and the cec.upcoming events:--  the assembly utilities and commerce committee is having an informationalhearing on tuesday, january 16th at 1:30 pm in room 4202.  iep will besetting up a conference call to discuss iep s involvement in this hearing.--end--julee malinowski-ballsenior associateedson +

regarding tva s appeal to a federal district court upcoming in november 2000.clean air act/new source review -- jeff keeler provided analysis to ena gas storage developers working on a project involving intermountain power authority in delta, ut.   ena is proposing installation of technologies that would use gas to increase the utilization of existing 1600 mw coal unit, which could raise serious concerns about epa scrutiny or enforcement of nsr regulations.  jeff also provided ena commercial and ehs staff with intelligence on epa letters of inquiry (which usually precede nsr enforcement actions) sent to pennsylvania non-utility coal plants, 3 of which ena is considering acquiring.clean air act/nox sip call -- mary schoen was successful in negotiating with tva and tennesee air regulators, reaching agreement that enron s sources would receive an allocation of 500 tons of nox per year (the levels that our facilities are currently permitted for).    earlier proposals would have limited or completely prevented enron from receiving nox allowances.  mary also testified before the illinois pollution control board on their sip development, advocating fair allocation of allowances to new sources and market-based trading systems.    clean air act/california air pollution offsets -- mary schoen held meetings with ena west developers regarding the shortage of air pollution offsets (required by local air quality districts) needed to develop power projects.   jeff and mary will be developing strategies for creating or obtaining offsets and working with california developers in the near future.environmental product strategy meeting -- stacey bolton continues to receive positive feedback from last week s meeting with commercial groups on opportunities related to green power/renewables.   stacey is working on developing a comprehensive analysis of markets for renewable energy, incentive monies, and supply/demand issues so that we can identify potential opportunities for enron businesses.   also, in anticipation of ees  development of a power quality group, mary and stacey will also be working on analysis of opportunities for distributed generation and other power quality related markets.environmental disclosure -- stacey submitted comments to the texas puc on a credit-based accounting system for environmental disclosure and met with the puc in support of enron s positions.   stacey is also developing a white paper on credit trading for use in maryland as they develop rules for disclosure.41502.44 473.13 33336 488.72 2768.86

<129000, [steve --i will be traveling back from ca tomorrow so i can t make the call.  some things to be aware of --1.	ees/eemc v. sce complaintwe filed aug 30 before the cpuc asking the cpuc to re-instate our customer net bill amounts.  jeff dasovich will call john fielder to try and see if there is anything that we can do without litigating the case (or at least delay until after legislative session).  if complaint moves forward, sce will probably consolidate the complaint with earlier disputes.  enron is preparing similar filing for pg&e, although we need to seek relief from the stay.  2.	california legislationsce mou bill (that includes da issues) moved aug 29 through assembly energy committee.  needs to go to assembly appropriation and full assembly.  hertzberg is trying to get out by weekend or early next week.  by removing the conservation easements, the bill has lost some liberal democrats.  governor davis is asking business to find 15+ republicans to move the bill.  trying to modify (1) surcharge effective date to sept 1+ and (2) get more comfort that sce will pay our negative ctc if $$ exists.also, the windfall profits bill has moved through assembly committee.  it has to go through assembly appropriation and full assembly.  jennifer thome has prepared a synopsis that is attached. 3.	ag subpeona / sen dunn subpeonalitigation about both subpeonas was heard this week in sf and sacramento.  mike kirby believes that he may have swayed the court in the sen dunn to provide a protective order.  a final decision may be issued next week.4.	ferc refund caseenron presented its "ripple" claim earlier this week.  range of refunds (non-netted) is very large (please see bob frank for exact $$).  i have also attached a calendar of both cases prepared by alan comnes.  oral testimony is being prepared in pnw case for next week. 5.	ne rto mediation / se rto mediationboth proceedings come to a close this week with an expectation that the alj issues a recommendation next week (or soon thereafter).  looks like the best date that a large number of parties can agree to for a single ne rto energy market is nov 03 (pjm thinks it can happen by may 03 but wants some cushion).  sarah novosel is trying to best position us vis-a-vis the other stakeholders to drive it earlier.  also, icap and control area consolidation is not considered at this time.  christi nicolay believes that the alj will recommend moving toward a pjm model.6.	cpuc decision to suspend da retroactivesue mara continues to push the cpuc to remove the retroactive date in the current proposed decision.  some rumors that the cpuc will again delay a decision until sept 13 (confirming so please keep close).14442.52 400.76 5121.66 379.2 36510.77 465.84 5053.53 473.13 19902.93 473.13 15997.53 433 38822.01 473.13 19456.91 464.6 38822.01 473.13 9999.3 473.13 69225.83 460.85 37294.55 473.13 13938.04 473.13 21958.55 426.87 27071.52 473.13 38822.01 473.13 26882.09 482.13 51292.99 473.13 26882.09 482.13 68512.59 473.13 53372.78 458.22 50615.52 341.85 26882.09 482.13 68512.59 473.13 55372.35 473.13 65030.98 473.13 26882.09 482.13 18186.04 436.14 26892.24 468.86 15508.99 473.13 65731.65 473.13 27071.52 473.13 15508.99 473.13 54153.66 473.13 62733.26 473.13 26882.09 482.13 54274.47 473.13 72191.84 473.13 ]>

legislative weekly report week ending 1/12recent events:-- iep has been meeting with legislators over the past two weeks.  janand//or katie and i have been attending these meetings.  since jan has beenin washington dc we have rescheduled some of the more important meetings forwhen he is back in town next week.  in general the meetings fall into twocategories and seem to be defined by party affiliation.  while this may notbe everyone s experience, our experience so far has showed that many of therepublicans have embraced our message and are offering to lend support wherethey are able.  many of the democrats have demonstrated extreme caution, areinterested in our message, but offering little or no support.  the majortheme for them is what they can take back to their districts.the one exception on the democratic side so far has been senator machado whohas requested iep draft language on long-term contracting.  senator billmorrow (r) has requested assistance in drafting language on the nimby sitingissue, which we agreed to do so.  we have agree to assist both.from hereon, we will focus on our meeting efforts on the new assembly ecacommittee members and "meet and greets" with the new members in both theassembly and the senate.  because this meeting list was changing on anhourly basis, it was impossible to forward to board members.  please besure, if you haven t already, to send us a list of your representatives sowe can contact you when a meeting with them has been confirmed.-- assembly u&c staff organized a meeting with the cec and generators withrepower projects.  generators in attendance included representatives fromduke, dynegy, southern, aes and sunrise (williams was there but didn tspeak).  after each of the participants airing their grievances, we weretasked with developing language, getting the generating industry to supportit and supporting it in the legislative process.  we were given until fridayto hand in bill language to the u&c staff.  such a commitment comes withmany promises and pitfalls which shuld be discussed next week on aconference call which iep will be setting up.-- as reported in an e-mail yesterday, the first two special session billspassed out of the new assembly energy costs and availability (eca) committeeyesterday (abx 5 and abx6, both attached, but amended versions not in printyet).  both measures also passed off the assembly floor today and are ontheir way to the senate for consideration in the senate energy committee.members of that committee have not yet been announced.-- the governor had a press conference today to announce a plan to reducecalifornia s energy use by at least five percent within a week.  during theq&a portion of the press conference the governor suggested the three membersof the new iso board should be the president of the cpuc, and the chairs ofthe eob and the cec.upcoming events:--  the assembly utilities and commerce committee is having an informationalhearing on tuesday, january 16th at 1:30 pm in room 4202.  iep will besetting up a conference call to discuss iep s involvement in this hearing.--end--julee malinowski-ballsenior associateedson +

<174811, [i know it must be frustrating being a ocean away and not really knowing what is going on.  i can assure you that at times i too feel that i do not know everything that is going and that is probably correct.  i can tell you that jeff mcmahon did receive the offer from the royal bank of scotland at or around rab.  i have supplied him the potential financial impact of enron accepting that offer.  as of yesterday no decision had been made about responding to their offer.  i suspect that a decision should be made early next week.  i would appreciate your thoughts as soon as you can supply them to me.ken lay and dynegy have both characterised enron s investments in water assets as non-core which means of cource that they will be divested in due time.  i would think that that would be the final straw that triggers the goodwill impairment.  we all recommended that if enron could not support the goodwill remaining on the books then we should proceed with trying to sell wessex at or around rab.  that is where we are right now.  again, please send me your comments.  i would try to keep this confidential since we have not yet made a descision.  i am sorry if i have not done a good job of communicating with you the past few weeks.  things are quite hectic as you can imagine. -----original message-----from: 	lisa hobbs <lisa.hobbs@wessexwater.co.uk>@enron   on behalf of colin skellett <colin.skellett@wessexwater.co.uk>sent:	friday, november 16, 2001 7:26 amto:	horton, stanleycc:	john l garrison (e-mail)subject:	wessex weekly updatestan,1.	there is still considerable speculation that wessex is to be sold byenron.  bill alexander, ceo of thames water is quoted as saying "we cannotoffer as much as enron paid but we can make enron a better company".  sincethames is well behind wessex in all the efficiency and service comparators,it is difficult to see quite how he intends to improve wessex!  any proposalby another uk water and wastewater company to buy wessex would trigger anautomatic competition commission reference.  previous references to thecompetition commission have resulted in such combinations not being allowed.the director general of water services has said publicly that he wouldoppose such combinations.2.	the royal bank of scotland have called to tell us "as a matter ofcourtesy", that they will be submitting an offer for wessex.  i believe itwill be "at or around" the rab value and will be sent to geoff macmahon.our response to rbs and to others who have called has been that ourunderstanding is that enron are not seeking to sell wessex at this time andto refer them to houston.3.	we remain on course to meet the full year earnings target.  this isdespite having to make greater provisions than we expected to restructureswiss combi technology following the decision of andritz to terminatediscussions to buy the company.4.	the ?50m index linked private placement is currently with thelawyers.  we are on track to close the transaction two weeks today.5	we will need to begin the process of renegotiating our committedbank facilities soon.  we are proceeding as previously agreed with benglisan.6.	 we have been contacted privately by s&p who have told us that theyare likely to put wessex and ael on credit watch (developing) to reflect thefinancial uncertainties around enron and the future ownership of wessex.colin**********************************************************************this email and any files transmitted with it are confidential andintended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom theyare addressed. if you have received this email in error please notifythe wessex water it support centre on:44-1225-528888 or email support@wessexwater.co.ukthis footnote also confirms that this email message has been swept bymimesweeper for the presence of computer viruses.www.mimesweeper.com**********************************************************************_____________________________________________________________________this message has been checked for all known viruses by themessagelabs virus scanning service. for further information visithttp://www.messagelabs.com/stats.asp1637.64 460.49 20109.74 416.39 25928.21 460.09 33378.52 466.73 51172.67 454.54 44137.45 473.13 68428.51 473.13 60531.22 465.01 38391.46 458.57 65224.27 473.13 72115.97 379.2 19097.4 610.46 41563.33 473.13 26882.09 482.13 36557.15 473.13 33781.53 473.13 42717.26 457.69 38391.46 458.57 54916.67 473.13 72933.1 473.13 26882.09 482.13 1530.85 473.13 7120.27 473.13 68270.98 473.13 17091.54 473.13 54153.66 473.13 33781.53 473.13 26882.09 482.13 29193.83 473.13 32617.93 435.33 9626.26 473.13 73289.72 473.13 3696.64 473.13 15808.59 473.13 4410.36 473.13 50736.32 473.13 51066.36 445.38 30414.93 485.87 ]>

<187176, [regulatory affairs- the oregon public utility commission today hosted a public hearing inportland to discuss the impacts of pge s oct. 1 price increase. the hearingwas conducted in response to a request by consumer and business interestgroups, even though the 11-month long rate case proceedings are officiallyclosed and the opuc approved pge s request. pamela lesh, pge s vice president of public policy and regulatory affairs,represented the company at the hearing. representatives and members of theinterest groups - industrial customers of northwest utilities, associatedoregon industries, and citizens utility board - also offered their comments. today s hearing is part of a larger campaign by these groups asking forreconsideration of pge s rate case. several weeks ago, the opuc denied theirrequest to block the implementation of new rates on october 1, 2001. a secondproposal by these groups is a request for reconsideration, in which the opuccould decide to create a plan to mitigate or defer the price increases overtime. this matter has yet to be decided by the opuc, but we expect them dodeny the reconsideration request. pge has stated that a price deferral or"phase-in" approach would not be wise, because it would create millions ofdollars in debt that would ultimately cost pge customers more in the longterm.  beginning this week, all residential and business customers willreceive a special mailing from pge that provides details on how customers canuse energy wisely and efficiently.retail loadswe re roughly 145 mw behind (authorized) ue-115 forecast in the last 7 daysand 135 mw behind (120 mw behind when adjusted for weather) in the last 30days, due to significantly weak demand by manufacturing customers (thoughhigh-tech held up well) and likely commercial (non-manufacturing) customers. you may have heard this morning that the u.s. industrial production (index)fell for 12 months in a row, worse since wwii.power supply- this past week we have seen the market continue to creep up slowly.  thedaily electric has strengthened mostly off-peak with a slight strengtheningon-peak, on-peak has traded mostly around $24 to $25 and off-peak has steadilymoved up from $18 to $21.  in the cash electric we have been selling about100mw on-peak and have stayed out of the off-peak market due to the gas pricefollowing the electric for beaver s dispatch price.  daily gas we have seenthe prices move up to $2.45 sumas and settled around $2.06 for tomorrow.  thishas been moving all around with weather forecasts being part of the driver andthreats of storms.  term electric had climbed slowly this past week with thefeeling that we reached the bottom, but has settled back down to last weekprices.  term gas has followed the electric with the prices rising slightlythroughout the week then settling down to last week prices.overall everything has been very quiet with everything running full out whenthe dispatch is below the market.  we aren t anticipating any majorfluctuation in the coming week that would cause either gas or electric to movedramatically.  all the plants are available and running smoothly.- el paso seasonal exchange - negotiations are in process with el paso on aseasonal exchange in which pge may take up to 50 mw of dec01 and jan02 powerin four-hour blocks.  total energy taken by pge must be returned in sep02 infour-hour blocks of el paso s choice.  el paso would like to embed a provisionfor "lending" - commercial terms are being negotiated.- intel blend and extend - initial contact with customer has been made andterms are being revised, as requested by intel.  at intel s firstavailability, pge will meet with them to discuss two products: (1) an "extendand blend" financing of a reduced rate increase and (2) an extend and blendproduct with financed rate reduction embedded in a collar.human resources- with ? day s negotiations, company and ibew successfully wrapped upnegotiations for a 5-year agreement for the 15 employees at our coyote plant.this unusual agreement which is ipp-like in its wording was unchanged throughthe negotiations process, with a cost-of-living adjustment added plus anincrease in the incentive plan of up to 4%. - in pge s main agreement covering 900 bargaining-unit employees, a third votewas held wed., 10/17, with the result 631 employee in favor of the new 3-yragreement and 174 opposed.  this is a good contract and it brings ournegotiation process to a conclusion.financea draft 8-k for pge is out for final review and approval.  once this is filedpge will be able to move forward on a $250 million bond deal structured as afall away first mortgage.   current issuance date for these bonds is scheduledfor october 31 or november 1.enron / northwest natural transaction- officers of nwn and pge will meet next week for 2 days to discuss how wework together during the approval process and the plan for the integrationactivity.- the regulatory and business people will meet next week (evening meetingwhile we are at the management meeting)  to discuss regulatory strategy forthe opuc filing that will request approval for the transaction.  paul kaufmanwill be included in the discussion along with dick reiten, mark dodson, brucedebolt, peggy fowler, jim piro, and pamela lesh.- final draft of the offering memo on the senior credit facility for thefinancing of the transaction is being circulated for review.  presentations onthe transaction with the potential lead underwriting banks is being scheduledfor october 29 and 30th.- beginning information exchange and planning for integration with nwnatural s human resources department, planning for day one.2574.12 473.13 11164.83 345.09 50153.56 454.24 26882.09 482.13 26882.09 482.13 69225.83 460.85 16068.56 471.42 22370.26 411.28 57025.45 473.13 51392.54 473.13 34086.93 473.13 26882.09 482.13 16068.56 471.42 2837.96 483.88 36009.18 473.13 26882.09 482.13 50119.25 473.13 2749.05 473.13 32830.55 473.13 35500.35 464.93 52617.02 473.13 62544.81 473.13 36504.97 473.13 72115.97 379.2 32457.02 511.8 74146.47 473.13 2348.46 473.13 16369.13 423.14 8677.69 473.13 33874.31 473.13 43415.03 473.13 49557.74 473.13 67249.45 473.13 23672.05 473.13 53352 452.19 73756.51 473.13 68512.59 473.13 6650.58 466.36 51084.24 473.13 30738.2 473.13 4410.36 473.13 15997.53 433 69039.79 473.13 13938.04 473.13 25428.56 473.13 26882.09 482.13 12284.46 466.82 14494.23 473.13 26882.09 482.13 68734.39 469.85 20899.81 473.13 33781.53 473.13 2768.86 463.04 26892.24 468.86 73532.3 473.13 2749.05 473.13 63318.93 473.13 64399.89 473.13 20496.81 473.13 15430.23 377.22 68512.59 473.13 20496.81 473.13 38391.46 458.57 21043.33 467.56 38434.95 473.13 9538.31 452.74 35172.24 473.13 74327.68 462.98 32008.59 473.13 ]>

legislative weekly report week ending 1/12recent events:-- iep has been meeting with legislators over the past two weeks.  janand//or katie and i have been attending these meetings.  since jan has beenin washington dc we have rescheduled some of the more important meetings forwhen he is back in town next week.  in general the meetings fall into twocategories and seem to be defined by party affiliation.  while this may notbe everyone s experience, our experience so far has showed that many of therepublicans have embraced our message and are offering to lend support wherethey are able.  many of the democrats have demonstrated extreme caution, areinterested in our message, but offering little or no support.  the majortheme for them is what they can take back to their districts.the one exception on the democratic side so far has been senator machado whohas requested iep draft language on long-term contracting.  senator billmorrow (r) has requested assistance in drafting language on the nimby sitingissue, which we agreed to do so.  we have agree to assist both.from hereon, we will focus on our meeting efforts on the new assembly ecacommittee members and "meet and greets" with the new members in both theassembly and the senate.  because this meeting list was changing on anhourly basis, it was impossible to forward to board members.  please besure, if you haven t already, to send us a list of your representatives sowe can contact you when a meeting with them has been confirmed.-- assembly u&c staff organized a meeting with the cec and generators withrepower projects.  generators in attendance included representatives fromduke, dynegy, southern, aes and sunrise (williams was there but didn tspeak).  after each of the participants airing their grievances, we weretasked with developing language, getting the generating industry to supportit and supporting it in the legislative process.  we were given until fridayto hand in bill language to the u&c staff.  such a commitment comes withmany promises and pitfalls which shuld be discussed next week on aconference call which iep will be setting up.-- as reported in an e-mail yesterday, the first two special session billspassed out of the new assembly energy costs and availability (eca) committeeyesterday (abx 5 and abx6, both attached, but amended versions not in printyet).  both measures also passed off the assembly floor today and are ontheir way to the senate for consideration in the senate energy committee.members of that committee have not yet been announced.-- the governor had a press conference today to announce a plan to reducecalifornia s energy use by at least five percent within a week.  during theq&a portion of the press conference the governor suggested the three membersof the new iso board should be the president of the cpuc, and the chairs ofthe eob and the cec.upcoming events:--  the assembly utilities and commerce committee is having an informationalhearing on tuesday, january 16th at 1:30 pm in room 4202.  iep will besetting up a conference call to discuss iep s involvement in this hearing.--end--julee malinowski-ballsenior associateedson +

<241932, [thanks for the vote!  dflee huber02/23/2001 05:18 pmto: drew fossum/et&s/enron@enroncc:  subject: weekly report for feb 201. mops.  suggested that the mops rehearing be brought to madden s attention.  as a result we are looking at filing a motion to expedite.  spent much of the week reviewing the mops proceeding up to date, reading pleadings and cases. drafted a motion to expedite which has been circulated for comment.  while it is not very compelling for expedition, it is a way to get the proceeding brought to ferc s attention.  apparently, there is a push to clean up old dockets.  also it brought to my attention that northern, in this proceeding, proposed to sell to enron gulf coast gathering, which i had forgotten.  so that if we find another purchaser, the filing will have to be amended. also the enron affiliate made the filing for the declaratory order.  kim wilkie and  were talking about mops and what needs to be done while she is out on maternity leave.  we were talking about the waiver and rofr agreements which john goodpasture is getting executed.  we need to review whatever was done, if anything, at the time of the original filing to sell to the affiliate. also take a look at the current ones to see if they would be broad enough to cover  not only northern but a subsequent sale by northern afilliate, if we should want to handle the sale of mops in that manner.  2.  attended the south end task force meeting tuesday morning.  it was a long meeting and quite productive. it was a brain dump by the south end commercial guys for shelley and mike and a man named mike gadd who called in from london who will work with danny mccarty on asset deals.  it was decided to go ahead and start presenting potential deals to various companies who we think would be interested in the various south end assets.  for examplebob burleson is going to present a deal for some permian assets to sps.  sps will have to divest certain power plants but still would like to maintain some control.   sps may be interested in purchasing the pipelines form northern and tw that currently serve the plants.  sps would operate the line as an intrastate hinshaw.  we think these asets are a good candidate to get stans approval since they are not useful to get gas to california and the cos is $18 and incremental revenue is $2-3.  i will be involved in putting the proposal together starting with confidentiality agreements.  shelley believes that we should actively package and seek out potential interested buyers.  for example, approach duke about the hugoton area because duke has a huge helium plant there. also talk to el paso because of its recent acqusition of cig and anr   and  interest in getting rocky moutain gas to cailf.  also seek out those interested in the beaver assets and go make a pitch.i am reading the existing contracts we have with oneok as well as gpm/duke to determine any adverse terms and conditions which could hinder a sale.another meeting is scheduled for the week of march 4 to go over the sps deal with stan. 3 ferc audit cwip.  continue working with gary zahn and michelle winckowski on a futher ferc inquiry on the sublette work order.  will prepare a response next week.next week continue work on the above items.by the way  good luck with getting mike s job if you want it.  we would be happy to have you here!!53163.06 457.69 67676.13 467.45 34086.93 473.13 25102.39 473.13 26882.09 482.13 33734.66 473.13 27071.52 473.13 26882.09 482.13 54615.14 422.63 1418.74 428.38 74943.79 463.08 26882.09 482.13 40372.19 473.13 27071.52 473.13 17806.23 473.13 38391.46 458.57 1218.68 473.13 61312.59 470.19 33781.53 473.13 32399.03 520.8 63506.9 473.13 29193.83 473.13 40093.85 473.13 68197.05 473.13 49143.14 466.82 65966.01 473.13 28432.75 616.38 23672.05 473.13 16012.99 473.13 32134.23 485.87 16099.49 464.6 46443.87 473.13 51699.38 498.77 68512.59 473.13 48800.54 467.29 37990.87 456.29 30685.05 478.72 ]>

(a 58% vote is required for passage.) an earlier version of the propo=sal had been passed by the mc but had been rejected by the iso board becaus=e it applied only to suppliers and not to all market participants found to =engage in behavior detrimental to the market. the psc-led effort to respond= to the board s concerns apparently caused enough supporters of the origina=l version to change their vote this time around. whether this effort is res=urrected again (by the psc/utilities or the board itself) may hinge on what= ferc decides with respect to the circuit breaker proposal pending before f=erc. the iso board has made clear it wants something in effect this summer =to help it  manage price spikes.unbundling of schedule 1 charges: efforts to finalize the unbundling of the= iso s fixed schedule 1 charges (nearly $100 million a year) were sent back= to a working group for further work. however, the direction to be taken fo=r some issues appears clear.=20tccs: we succeeded in convincing the group that no costs should be assigned= to existing tccs, and that if costs are to be assigned to this market, the=y should be allocated on the basis of the relative price paid for the tccs =compared to the annual auction revenues, rather than on the basis of number= of tccs purchased.exports and wheelthroughs: we succeeded in getting a separate category crea=ted for these transactions that will result in $/mwh costs that are much le=ss than what is currently charged. conversely, there is now likely to be a =small charge on imports into ny; however, since all generation will be hit =with this charge, it should be reflected in everyone s bids equally and sim=ply passed on to the loads through the market clearing price.the exact amount of these various charges will depend on resolution of a nu=mber of issues including whether the tos should be assessed a portion of th=e iso s overhead right off the top.----- forwarded by howard fromer/na/enron on 06/08/2001 02:00 pm -----=09kkranz@nyiso.com sent by: owner-nyiso_bic@lists.nyiso.com 06/08/2001 12:=46 pm =09   to: market_relations@nyiso.com  cc:   subject: nyiso - weekly u=pdate 6/8/01=09dear members of the mc, bic, oc, and tie list,attached, please find the nyiso weekly update.  this updateis written jointly by mollie lampi and other nyiso staff.the nyiso weekly update provides a brief status report of, orprogress on, a range of issues that are under discussion at nyisocommittee meetings or are being undertaken by nyiso staff.many, but not all, of these issues are being addressed through thenyiso committee structure.  market participants may raise anycomments or questions on items covered in the update throughthe committee structure, or directly to mollie lampi (mlampi@nyiso.com.).prior editions of the weekly update on the "nyiso committees"page of the nyiso web site:http://www.nyiso.com ---> services ---> committees ---> weekly updateor by clicking on the following link:http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/groups/weekly_updates/wkly_updates.=html(see attached file: weekly060801.pdf) - weekly060801.pdf24227.28 473.13 51523.97 460.49 9025.61 473.13 32008.59 473.13 22827.38 473.13 32399.03 520.8 44844.4 473.13 2768.86 463.04 33781.53 473.13 24617.23 473.13 15297.83 466.75 43355.11 473.13 62568 473.13 48237.1 468.91 48237.1 468.91 26695.57 490.56 35551.57 305.81 20369.72 464.19 7712.21 450.83 33953.07 473.13 24832.27 473.13 33953.07 473.13 72504.97 473.13 73289.72 473.13 47661.1 452.86 65627.76 473.13 35787.87 473.13 56591.03 473.13 59258.42 717.47 8677.69 473.13 1418.74 428.38 35435.6 473.13 13680.48 473.13 26882.09 482.13 68386.95 473.13 26882.09 482.13 44888.86 473.13 23784.16 473.13 38391.46 458.57 56866.95 558.15 4410.36 473.13 38391.46 458.57 40810.95 456.29 40810.95 456.29 72191.84 473.13 4410.36 473.13 43616.05 465.98 55843.01 449.34 4295.36 457.69 32008.59 473.13 46315.81 473.13 53372.78 458.22 4410.36 473.13 72933.1 473.13 68270.98 473.13 61859.6 473.13 2749.05 473.13 61859.6 473.13 74394.36 473.13 2749.05 473.13 54791.52 473.13 ]>

<369914, [sally- i will gladly include you on the distribution of the weekly status on the mg acquisition and integration and instruct esther gerratt to add your name to the list.i concur that brent s return to houston will create a potential information gap that even the best of weekly reports won t fill.  i think we may have an opportunity to keep your information level high and address my need to assess mg s remote offices.  if brent were to linger in london for a few more months, we could lay out a program to assess mg s 24 offices around the world and benchmark their compliance with risk policies + procedures.  brent s background and recent experience with doorstep give him strong credentials for doing the job.  i haven t discussed this with mg s management, but it seems to be the right kind of activity for a new owner to undertake.  what are your thoughts?   	enron capital & trade resources corp.		from:  sally beck                           13/06/2000 19:57	to: eric gadd/lon/ect@ectcc: brent a price/hou/ect@ect subject: weekly update on mg aquisition and assimilationi have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the mg aquisition and assimilation.  would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week?   i believe that it is assumed that fernley dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed.  however, in my role over global risk management operations, i find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.  brent price, who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the london office, has been keeping me updated on progress to date.  his return soon to houston, however, will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill.  thanks in advance to your attention to this.40781.48 473.13 32280.64 473.13 51172.67 454.54 57719.36 473.13 26882.09 482.13 40781.48 473.13 38391.46 458.57 20352.32 473.13 4410.36 473.13 57719.36 473.13 36291.87 473.13 72191.84 473.13 15080.38 435.3 69225.83 460.85 23294.66 488.72 27929.72 473.13 7712.21 450.83 43745.56 473.13 26892.24 468.86 10459.81 473.13 53163.06 457.69 ]>

for economy and small  business sbsc president darrell mckigney testified  before the house small business committee on october 10.  mckigney explained the important role  that small business plays in the economy, and laid out a pro-small business  policy agenda that featured speeding up and making permanent the tax cuts  passed earlier this year; cutting or eliminating the capital gains tax;  granting the president trade promotion authority; and enacting an energy plan  that frees up domestic energy producers. to read the full testimony, go  to: http://www.sbsc.org/congressionaltestimony.asp?formmode=congressionaltestimony&id=40 2.   sbsc  addresses media on small business and economic  issues on october 11, sbsc chairman karen  kerrigan, president darrell mckigney, and chief economist raymond j. keating  discussed the state of small business and the economy in a tele-conference  call with reporters from newsweek,  business week, newsday, human events, cnsnews.com, baltimore sun, arizona  republic and the orange county  register.  2.    free  trade for small business, trade promotion authority for the  president sbsc chief economist raymond j. keating  wrote a new report--"international trade: the business of small business"-that  explains the importance of free and open trade for our economy and for the  small business community.  keating  lays out a pro-free trade agenda, featuring passage of trade promotion  authority for the president. sbsc s report "international trade: the  business of small business" can be downloaded from the front page at http://www.sbsc.org/under the "21st  century small business policy series." 3.    sbsc  and other groups urge congress to grant tpa to president  bush sbsc chairman karen kerrigan signed an  october 9 letter to congress urging passage of trade promotion authority (tpa)  for the president.  in part, the  letter said: "world trade is increasingly important to small business.   nearly one-third of all u.s. merchandise export sales -- the stuff whose  labels read, "made in america"-- are produced by companies with less than 500  people on their payrolls.  two-thirds of the firms participating in the  export economy actually have less than 20 employees. what s more, the overall  value of small-business exports has increased by 300 percent since the  mid-1990s, according to the u.s. small business administration.  between  1987 and 1997, the number of u.s. small business exporters tripled from 65,900  to 202,185, according to the u.s. department of commerce.  that number  will grow substantially if president bush were given trade promotion  authority." to read the full letter to congress, go  to: http://www.sbsc.org/letterstocongress.asp?formmode=letterstocongress&id=113 5.  sbsc chairman maps out road to recovery in a recent article written for the washington times, sbsc chairman  karen kerrigan spelled out the policies needed to put the economy and the  entrepreneurial sector of the u.s. economy back on a path of  growth. to read the full washington times op-ed by kerrigan, go  to: http://www.sbsc.org/latestnews_action.asp?formmode=smallbusbriefs&id=113 6. capital gains tax cut-good for the  economy, good for the stock market in his latest sbsc cybercolumn, sbsc chief  economist raymond j. keating explains why cutting the capital gains tax is  good for both the economy and the stock market, and provides the historical  evidence to back up his claims. to read the sbsc cybercolumn, go  to: http://www.sbsc.org/latestnews_action.asp?formmode=cybercolumn&id=178 7.  msas and the  uninsured in the sbsc fact of the week, the latest  numbers show that tax-free medical savings accounts help to reduce the number  of uninsured individuals. http://www.sbsc.org/factofweek.asp?formmode=call&linktype=text&id=162 8.  sbsc organizes allies to oppose "one-watt" mandates in senate energy  legislation  in an october 5 letter to congress, sbsc  chairman karen kerrigan and representatives from other groups wrote: "while it  is still uncertain whether the senate will consider comprehensive energy  legislation, we are writing to alert you to our concern about a specific  provision that could undermine the current work of the congress to bring  stability and growth to our nation s economy.  as this important  legislation is being debated, we urge you to proceed with caution in imposing  new burdens on businesses and consumers through mandates and regulations.   specifically, we are asking that you reject the onerous "one-watt"  provisions similar to those slipped into the house energy bill, h.r. 4.   if enacted, these one-watt restrictions will cost consumers money and  convenience, place undue burdens on businesses, while creating a new layer of  government bureaucracy." to read the rest of this letter, go  to: http://www.sbsc.org/letterstocongress.asp?formmode=letterstocongress&id=112   9.  old-time  baseball in their latest "carolan & keating"  newsday column, sbsc chief economist raymond j. keating and
